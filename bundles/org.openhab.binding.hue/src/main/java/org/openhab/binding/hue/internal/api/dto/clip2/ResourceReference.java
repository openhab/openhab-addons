/**
 * DTO that contains an API reference element.
 *
 * The V2 API is set up in such a way that all resources of the same type are grouped together under the
 * {@code /resource/<resourcetype>} endpoint, but all those resources commonly reference each other, which is done in a
 * standardized way by indicating the resource type (rtype) and resource id (rid).
 *
 * A typical usage is in a single physical device that hosts multiple services. An existing example is the Philips Hue
 * Motion sensor which has a motion, light_level, and temperature service, but theoretically any combination can be
 * supported such as an integrated device with two independently controllable light points and a motion sensor.
 *
 * This means that the information of the device itself can be found under the /device resource endpoint, but it then
 * contains a services array which references for example the light and motion resources, for which the details can be
 * found under the /light and /motion resource endpoints respectively. Other services the device might have, such as a
 * Zigbee radio (zigbee_connectivy) or battery (device_power) are modeled in the same way.
