# Philips Hue Binding Configuration for API v1

[Back to Overview](../README.md#philips-hue-binding)

## Supported Things

Almost all available Hue devices are supported by this binding.
This includes not only the "Friends of Hue", but also products like the LivingWhites adapter.
Additionally, it is possible to use OSRAM Lightify devices as well as other Zigbee Light Link compatible products, including the IKEA TRÃ…DFRI lights (when updated).
Beside bulbs and luminaires the Hue binding also supports some Zigbee sensors. Currently only Hue specific sensors are tested successfully (Hue Motion Sensor and Hue Dimmer Switch).
Please note that the devices need to be registered with the Hue Bridge before it is possible for this binding to use them.

The Hue binding supports all seven types of lighting devices defined for Zigbee Light Link ([see page 24, table 2](https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/user-guide/JN-UG-3091.pdf).
These are:

| Device type              | Zigbee Device ID | Thing type |
|--------------------------|------------------|------------|
| On/Off Light             | 0x0000           | 0000       |
| On/Off Plug-in Unit      | 0x0010           | 0010       |
| Dimmable Light           | 0x0100           | 0100       |
| Dimmable Plug-in Unit    | 0x0110           | 0110       |
| Colour Light             | 0x0200           | 0200       |
| Extended Colour Light    | 0x0210           | 0210       |
| Colour Temperature Light | 0x0220           | 0220       |

All different models of Hue, OSRAM, or other bulbs nicely fit into one of these seven types.
This type also determines the capability of a device and with that the possible ways of interacting with it.
The following matrix lists the capabilities (channels) for each type:

| Thing type  | On/Off | Brightness | Color | Color Temperature |
|-------------|:------:|:----------:|:-----:|:-----------------:|
|  0000       |    X   |            |       |                   |
|  0010       |    X   |            |       |                   |
|  0100       |    X   |     X      |       |                   |
|  0110       |    X   |     X      |       |                   |
|  0200       |    X   |            |   X   |                   |
|  0210       |    X   |            |   X   |          X        |
|  0220       |    X   |     X      |       |          X        |

Beside bulbs and luminaires the Hue binding supports some Zigbee sensors.
Currently only Hue specific sensors are tested successfully (e.g. Hue Motion Sensor, Hue Dimmer Switch, Hue Tap, CLIP Sensor).
The Hue Motion Sensor registers a `ZLLLightLevel` sensor (0106), a `ZLLPresence` sensor (0107) and a `ZLLTemperature` sensor (0302) in one device.
The Hue CLIP Sensor saves scene states with status or flag for HUE rules.
They are presented by the following Zigbee Device ID and _Thing type_:

| Device type                 | Zigbee Device ID | Thing type     |
|-----------------------------|------------------|----------------|
| Light Sensor                | 0x0106           | 0106           |
| Occupancy Sensor            | 0x0107           | 0107           |
| Temperature Sensor          | 0x0302           | 0302           |
| Non-Colour Controller       | 0x0820           | 0820           |
| Non-Colour Scene Controller | 0x0830           | 0830           |
| CLIP Generic Status Sensor  | 0x0840           | 0840           |
| CLIP Generic Flag Sensor    | 0x0850           | 0850           |
| Geofence Sensor             |                  | geofencesensor |

The Hue Dimmer Switch has 4 buttons and registers as a Non-Colour Controller switch, while the Hue Tap (also 4 buttons) registers as a Non-Colour Scene Controller in accordance with the ZLL standard.

Also, Hue Bridge support CLIP Generic Status Sensor and CLIP Generic Flag Sensor.
These sensors save state for rules and calculate what actions to do.
CLIP Sensor set or get by JSON through IP.

Finally, the Hue binding also supports the groups of lights and rooms set up on the Hue Bridge.

## Thing Configuration

The Hue Bridge requires the IP address as a configuration value in order for the binding to know where to access it.
In the thing file, this looks e.g. like

```java
Bridge hue:bridge:1 [ ipAddress="192.168.0.64" ]
```

A user to authenticate against the Hue Bridge is automatically generated.
Please note that the generated user name cannot be written automatically to the `.things` file, and has to be set manually.
The generated user name can be found, after pressing the authentication button on the bridge, with the following console command: `hue <bridgeUID> username`.
The user name can be set using the `userName` configuration value, e.g.:

```java
Bridge hue:bridge:1 [ ipAddress="192.168.0.64", userName="qwertzuiopasdfghjklyxcvbnm1234" ]
```

| sensorPollingInterval    | Milliseconds between fetching sensor-values from the Hue Bridge. A higher value means more delay for the sensor values, but a too low value can cause congestion on the bridge. Optional, the default value is 500. Default value will be considered if the value is lower than 50. Use 0 to disable the polling for sensors. |

### Devices

The devices are identified by the number that the Hue Bridge assigns to them (also shown in the Hue App as an identifier).
Thus, all it needs for manual configuration is this single value like

```java
0210 bulb1 "Lamp 1" @ "Office" [ lightId="1" ]
```

or

```java
0107 motion-sensor "Motion Sensor" @ "Entrance" [ sensorId="4" ]
```

You can freely choose the thing identifier (such as motion-sensor), its name (such as "Motion Sensor") and the location (such as "Entrance").

The following device types also have an optional configuration value to specify the fade time in milliseconds for the transition to a new state:

- Dimmable Light
- Dimmable Plug-in Unit
- Colour Light
- Extended Colour Light
- Colour Temperature Light

| Parameter | Description                                                                   |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| lightId   | Number of the device provided by the Hue Bridge. **Mandatory**                |
| fadetime  | Fade time in Milliseconds to a new state (min="0", step="100", default="400") |


### Groups

The groups are identified by the number that the Hue Bridge assigns to them.
Thus, all it needs for manual configuration is this single value like

```java
group kitchen-bulbs "Kitchen Lamps" @ "Kitchen" [ groupId="1" ]
```

You can freely choose the thing identifier (such as kitchen-bulbs), its name (such as "Kitchen Lamps") and the location (such as "Kitchen").

The group type also have an optional configuration value to specify the fade time in milliseconds for the transition to a new state.

| Parameter | Description                                                                   |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| groupId   | Number of the group provided by the Hue Bridge. **Mandatory**                 |
| fadetime  | Fade time in Milliseconds to a new state (min="0", step="100", default="400") |

| Button 2 (DIM UP)   | INITIAL_PRESSED | 2000  |
|                     | HOLD            | 2001  |
|                     | SHORT RELEASED  | 2002  |
|                     | LONG RELEASED   | 2003  |
| Button 3 (DIM DOWN) | INITIAL_PRESSED | 3000  |
|                     | HOLD            | 3001  |
|                     | SHORT RELEASED  | 3002  |
|                     | LONG RELEASED   | 3003  |

|                     | LONG RELEASED   | 4003  |

The `tap_switch_event` can trigger one of the following events:

| Button   | State    | Event |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Button 1 | Button 1 | 34    |
| Button 2 | Button 2 | 16    |

## Rule Actions

This binding includes a rule action, which allows to change a light channel with a specific fading time from within rules.
There is a separate instance for each light or light group, which can be retrieved e.g. through

```php
val hueActions = getActions("hue","hue:0210:00178810d0dc:1")
```

where the first parameter always has to be `hue` and the second is the full Thing UID of the light that should be used.
Once this action instance is retrieved, you can invoke the `fadingLightCommand(String channel, Command command, DecimalType fadeTime)` method on it:

```php
hueActions.fadingLightCommand("color", new PercentType(100), new DecimalType(1000))
```

| Parameter | Description                                                                                      |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| channel   | The following channels have fade time support: **brightness, color, color_temperature, switch**  |
| command   | All commands supported by the channel can be used                                                |
| fadeTime  | Fade time in milliseconds to a new light value (min="0", step="100")                             |

## Full Example

In this example **bulb1** is a standard Philips Hue bulb (LCT001) which supports `color` and `color_temperature`.
Therefore it is a thing of type **0210**.
**bulb2** is an OSRAM tunable white bulb (PAR16 50 TW) supporting `color_temperature` and so the type is **0220**.
And there is one Hue Motion Sensor (represented by three devices) and a Hue Dimmer Switch **dimmer-switch** with a Rule to trigger an action when a key has been pressed.

### demo.items:

```java
// Bulb1
Switch  Light1_Toggle       { channel="hue:0210:1:bulb1:color" }
Dimmer  Light1_Dimmer       { channel="hue:0210:1:bulb1:color" }

// Motion Sensor
Switch   MotionSensorPresence     { channel="hue:0107:1:motion-sensor:presence" }
DateTime MotionSensorLastUpdate   { channel="hue:0107:1:motion-sensor:last_updated" }
Number   MotionSensorBatteryLevel { channel="hue:0107:1:motion-sensor:battery_level" }
Switch   MotionSensorLowBattery   { channel="hue:0107:1:motion-sensor:battery_low" }

// Temperature Sensor
Number:Temperature TemperatureSensorTemperature { channel="hue:0302:1:temperature-sensor:temperature" }

// Scenes
String LightScene { channel="hue:bridge:1:scene"}
```

Note: The bridge ID is in this example **1** but can be different in each system.
Also, if you are doing all your configuration through files, you may add the full bridge id to the channel definitions (e.g. `channel="hue:0210:00178810d0dc:bulb1:color`) instead of the short version (e.g. `channel="hue:0210:1:bulb1:color`) to prevent frequent discovery messages in the log file.

    }
}
```

### Events

 ```php
rule "example trigger rule"
when
    Channel "hue:0820:1:dimmer-switch:dimmer_switch_event" triggered <EVENT>
then
    ...
end
```

The optional `<EVENT>` represents one of the button events that are generated by the Hue Dimmer Switch.
If ommited the rule gets triggered by any key action and you can determine the event that triggered it with the `receivedEvent` method.
Be aware that the events have a '.0' attached to them, like `2001.0` or `34.0`.
So, testing for specific events looks like this:

```php
if (receivedEvent == "1000.0") {
    //do stuff
}
```
