## Learning Remote Codes

To obtain the command codes, you can get this binding to put your Broadlink RMx device into "learn mode" and then ask it for the code it learnt.
Here are the steps:

0. In the openHAB web UI, navigate to your RMx Thing
1. Set the *Name of IR/RF command to learn* property to the name of the command you want the device to learn
2. Click on its *Channels* tab
3. For IR find the *Remote Learning Control* channel and create an Item for it, for RF use the *Remote RF Learning Control* channel instead.(Only needed the first time)
4. Click the item, and click the rectangular area that is marked NULL
5. In the pop-up menu that appears, select *Learn IR command* for IR or *Learn RF command* for RF
6. *The LED on your RM device will illuminate solidly*
7. Point your IR/RF remote control at your RM device and keep pressing the button you'd like to learn. For RF, this can take 10-30 seconds
8. *The LED on your RM device will extinguish once it has identified the command*
9. If the command has been identified succesfully, the channel will have changed it name to "Learn command" or *RF command learnt*
10. If no succes, the channel will be named "NULL". Inspect the `openhab.log` file on your openHAB server for any issues
11. Check and save the IR/RF command by clicking the item once more and select "Check and save command".
12. Keep pressing the remote control with the command to check and save
13. If succesfull, the channel will change name to the command saved
14. If no succes, the channel be named "NULL", restart from step 3.

### Modify or Delete Remote Codes

The binding is also capable of modifying a previously stored code, and to delete a previously stored code.

To modify a previously stored code, the procedure is the same as the one shown above, except that in step 4, the option to choose is *Modify IR command* or *Modify RF Command*

*Please note that the "Learn command" will not modify a previously existent code, and the "Modify" command will not create a new command.
This is done to avoid accidentally overwriting commands*

In order to delete a previously stored code, the procedure is as follows:

0. In the openHAB web UI, navigate to your RMx Thing
1. Set the *Name of IR/RF command to learn* property to the name of the command you want the device to learn
2. Click on its *Channels* tab
3. For IR find the *Remote Learning Control* channel and create an Item for it, for RF use the *Remote RF Learning Control* channel instead (Only needed the first time).
4. Click the item, and click the rectangular area that is marked NULL
5. In the pop-up menu that appears, select *Delete IR command* for IR or *Delete RF command* for RF

*VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: As of openHAB version 4.3.0, writing the codes into the files is handled by openHAB. While it is possible to create a file externally, copy it in the proper location and use it as a remote codes database (As it is done in the case of Remote codes file migration) IT IS STRONGLY DISCOURAGED to modify the file while the binding is acive. Please make sure the binding is stopped before you modify a remote codes file manually. Also, have the following things in mind:*

*-openHAB does not interpret a missing code file as empty. It will assume the file is corrupt and try to read from one of the backups, which can lead to confusion. if you want to empty your code file, create an empty file with a set of culry brackets, one per line*

*-Remember if you manipulate the code file manually, remember to provide the proper location, and the proper ownership and permissions (Location is `$OPENHAB_USERDATA`, and permissions are `-rw-r--r-- 1 openhab openhab*

## Full Example

Items file example; `sockets.items`:

```java
Switch BroadlinkSP3 "Christmas Lights" [ "Lighting" ] { channel="broadlink:sp3:34-ea-34-22-44-66:power-on" } 
```


Thing file example; `rm.things`:

```java
Thing broadlink:rm4pro:IR_Downstairs "RM 4 Pro IR controller"  [ macAddress="e8:16:56:1c:7e:b9", ipAddress="192.168.178.234" ]
Thing broadlink:rm3q:IR_Upstairs "RM 3 IR controller"  [ macAddress="24:df:a7:df:0d:53", ipAddress="192.168.178.232" ]
```

Items file example; `rm.items`:

```java
Switch DownstairsAC

Number:Temperature DownstairsTemperature "Temperature downstairs" <temperature> ["Temperature", "Measurement"] { channel="broadlink:rm4pro:IR_Downstairs:temperature", unit="Â°C", stateDescription=" " [pattern="%.1f %unit%"]} 
Number:Dimensionless DownstairsHumidity "Humidity downstairs" <humidity> { channel="broadlink:rm4pro:IR_Downstairs:humidity", unit="%" }

String IR_Downstairs "Downstairs IR control" { channel="broadlink:rm4pro:IR_Downstairs:command" }
```

Rule file example; `AC.rules`:

```java
rule " AC_Control started"
when
  System started
then
  DownstairsAC.sendCommand(OFF)
  IR_Downstairs.sendCommand("AC_OFF")
end

rule "Downstairs AC Off"
when
  Item DownstairsAC changed to OFF
then
  IR_Downstairs.sendCommand("AC_OFF")
end

rule "Downstairs AC On"
when
  Item DownstairsAC changed to ON
then
  IR_Downstairs.sendCommand("AC_ON")
end
```

This rule file assumes you previously have learned the "AC_ON" and "AC_OFF" IR commands.


## Migrating Legacy Map File

Up to openHAB version 3.3, there was a previous version of this binding that was not part of the openHAB distribution.
It stored the IR/RF commands in a different place and a different format.
If you want to mirgrate from those versions to this version of the binding, please read this section.

The Broadlink RM family of devices can transmit IR codes. The pro models add RF codes.
The map file contains a list of IR/RF command codes to send via the device.

IR codes are store in `$OPENHAB_USERDATA/jsondb/broadlink_ir.json` and for the RM Pro series of devices the RF codes are store in `$OPENHAB_USERDATA/jsondb/broadlink_rf.json`

Before openHAB version 4.3.0, the file used the [Java Properties File format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.properties) and was stored in the `<OPENHAB_CONF>/transform` folder.
By default, the file name was `broadlink.map` for the IR codes, but could be changed using the `mapFile` setting.
In similar fashion, the RM pro models stored the RF codes in the `broadlinkrf.map` file.

Here is a map file example of the previous file format:

```
TV_POWER=26008c0092961039103a1039101510151014101510151039103a10391015101411141015101510141139101510141114101510151014103a10141139103911391037123a10391000060092961039103911391014111410151015101411391039103a101411141015101510141015103911141015101510141015101510391015103911391039103a1039103911000d05000000000000000000000000
heatpump_off=2600760069380D0C0D0C0D290D0C0D290D0C0D0C0D0C0D290D290D0C0D0C0D0C0D290D290D0C0D0C0D0C0D0C0D0C0D0C0D0C0D0C0D0C0D0C0D0C0D0C0D0C0D290D0C0D0C0D0C0D0C0D0C0D0C0D0C0D290D0C0D0C0D0C0D0C0D290D0C0D0C0D0C0D0C0D0C0D0C0D290D0C0D290D290D290D290D290D290E0002900000
```

The above codes are power on/off for Samsung TVs and Power Off for a Fujitsu heat pump.
To send either code, the string `TV_POWER` or `heatpump_off` must be sent to the `command` channel for the device.
For RF, the `rf-command` channel is used.

Storage of codes is handled by openHAB. The map files are stored in the $OPENHAB_USERDATA/jsondb directory.
As an advantage, the files are now backed up by openHAB, which is more practical for migrations, data robustness, etc. having the storage of the codes handled by openHAB also provides uniformity in where the files are stored.

With the change of the storage mechanism, the files are also changing format, and codes are now stored in json.

  },

  }
}

The code shown below is a Python script that can be used to convert from the old format to the new one:

```python
import csv
import json
import sys
import argparse

parser=argparse.ArgumentParser(description= "Broadlink converter argument parser")
parser.add_argument('-i','--input_filename', help='Input File Name', required=True)
parser.add_argument('-o','--output_filename', help='Output File Name')
args=parser.parse_args()

result={}
with open(args.input_filename,'r') as f:
    red=csv.reader(f, delimiter='=')
    for d in red:
        result[d[0]] = { "class": "java.lang.String" , "value":d[1]}
if args.output_filename:
    with open(args.output_filename, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        json.dump(result, f, ensure_ascii=False, indent=2)
else:
    print(json.dumps(result,indent=2))
```
