# Ecovacs Binding

This binding provides integration for vacuum cleaning / mopping robots made by Ecovacs (<https://www.ecovacs.com/>).
It discovers devices and communicates to them by using Ecovacs' cloud services.

## Supported Things

- Ecovacs cloud API (`ecovacsapi`)
- Vacuum cleaner (`vacuum`)

At this point, the following devices are fully supported and verified to be working:

- Deebot OZMO 900/905
- Deebot OZMO 920
- Deebot OZMO 930
- Deebot OZMO 950
- Deebot OZMO Slim 10/11
- Deebot N8 series

The following devices will likely work because they are using similar protocols as the above ones:

- Deebot 600/601/605
- Deebot 900/901
- Deebot OZMO 610
- Deebot 710/711/711s
- Deebot OZMO T5
- Deebot (OZMO) T8 series
- Deebot T9 series
- Deebot Slim 2
- Deebot N3 MAX
- Deebot N7
- Deebot U2 series
- Deebot X1 Omni

## Discovery

At first, you need to manually create the bridge thing for the cloud API.
Once that is done, the supported devices will be automatically discovered and added to the inbox.

## Thing Configuration

For the cloud API thing, the following parameters must be configured:

| Config    | Description                                                                                                                   |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| email     | The email address you used when registering the Ecovacs cloud account                                                         |
| password  | The cloud account password                                                                                                    |
| continent | The continent you are residing on, or 'World' if none matches. This is used to select the correct cloud server to connect to. |

For the vacuum things, there is no required configuration (when using discovery). The following parameters exist:

| Config       | Description                                                                                                                   |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| serialNumber | Required: The device's serial number as printed on the barcode below the dust bin. Filled automatically when using discovery. |
| refresh      | Refresh interval for polled data (see below), in minutes. By default set to 5 minutes.                                        |

## Channels

The list below lists all channels supported by the binding.
In case a particular channel is not supported by a given device (see remarks), it is automatically removed from the given thing.

| Channel                                 | Type                 | Description                                               | Read Only | Updated By | Remarks  |

## Command Channel Actions

The following actions are supported by the `command` channel:

| Name         | Action                                    | Remarks                                              |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `clean`      | Start cleaning in automatic mode.         |                                                      |
| `spotArea`   | Start cleaning specific rooms.            | <ul><li>Only if supported by device, which can be recognized by `spotArea` being present in the list of possible states of the `current-cleaning-mode` channel.</li><li>Format: `spotArea:<room IDs>`, where `room IDs` is a semicolon separated list of room letters as shown in Ecovacs' app, so a valid command could e.g. be `spotArea:A;D;E`.</li><li>If you want to run 2 clean passes, amend `:x2` to the command, e.g. `spotArea:A;C;B:x2`.</li></ul> |
| `customArea` | Start cleaning specific areas.            | <ul><li>Only if supported by device, which can be recognized by `customArea` being present in the list of possible states of the `current-cleaning-mode` channel.</li><li>Format: `customArea:<x1>;<y1>;<x2>;<y2>`, where the parameters are coordinates (in mm) relative to the map.</li><li>The coordinates can be obtained from the `current-cleaning-spot-definition` channel when starting a custom area run from the app.</li><li>If you want to run 2 clean passes, amend `:x2` to the command, e.g. `customArea:100;100;1000;1000:x2`.</li></ul> |
| `pause`      | Pause cleaning if it's currently active.  | If the device is idle, the command is ignored.       |
| `resume`     | Resume cleaning if it's currently paused. | If the device is not paused, the command is ignored. |
| `stop`       | Stop cleaning immediately.                |                                                      |
| `charge`     | Send device to charging station.          |                                                      |

## Rule actions

This binding includes a rule action, which allows playback of specific sounds on the device in case the device has a speaker.
There is a separate instance for each device, which can be retrieved like this:

```java
val vacuumActions = getActions("ecovacs","ecovacs:vacuum:1234567890")
```

where the first parameter always has to be `ecovacs` and the second is the full Thing UID of the device that should be used.
Once this action instance is retrieved, you can invoke the `playSound(String type)` method on it:

```java
vacuumActions.playSound("beep")
```

Supported sound types include:

- `beep`
- `iAmHere`
- `startup`
- `suspended`
- `batteryLow`

For special use cases, there is also a `playSoundWithId(int soundId)` method, where you can pass the numeric ID of the sound to play.
The exact meaning of the number depends on the specific device; you'll need to experiment with different numbers to see how the number-to-sound mapping looks like.
For reference, a list for the Deebot 900 can be found [here](https://github.com/bmartin5692/sucks/blob/D901/protocol.md#user-content-sounds).

## File Based Configuration

If you want to create the API bridge in a .things file, the entry has to look as follows:

```java
Bridge ecovacs:ecovacsapi:ecovacsapi [ email="your.email@provider.com", password="yourpassword", continent="ww" ]
```

The possible values for `continent` include the following values:

- `ww` for World
- `eu` for Europe
- `na` for North America
- `as` for Asia

The devices are detected automatically.
If you also want to enter those manually, the syntax is as follows:

```java
Bridge ecovacs:ecovacsapi:ecovacsapi [ email="your.email@provider.com", password="yourpassword", continent="ww" ]
{
    Thing vacuum myDeebot "Deebot Vacuum" [ serialNumber="serial as printed on label below dust bin" ]
}
```

## Adding support for unsupported models

When encountering an unsupported model during discovery, the binding creates a log message like this one:

```
2023-04-21 12:02:39.607 [INFO ] [acs.internal.api.impl.EcovacsApiImpl] - Found unsupported device DEEBOT N8 PRO CARE (class s1f8g7, company eco-ng), ignoring.
```

In such a case, please [create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/openhab/openhab-addons/issues), listing the contents of the log line.
In addition to that, if the model is similar to an already supported one, you can try to add the support yourself (until getting an updated binding).
For doing so, you can follow the following steps:

- create the folder `<OPENHAB_USERDATA>/ecovacs` (if not done previously)
- create a file named `custom_device_descs.json`, whose format of that file is the same as [the built-in device list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openhab/openhab-addons/main/bundles/org.openhab.binding.ecovacs/src/main/resources/devices/supported_device_list.json)
- for a model that is very similar to an existing one, create an entry with `modelName`, `deviceClass` (from the log line) and `deviceClassLink` (`deviceClass` of the similar model)
- for other models, you can also try experimenting with creating a full entry, but it's likely that the binding code will need to be updated in that case
