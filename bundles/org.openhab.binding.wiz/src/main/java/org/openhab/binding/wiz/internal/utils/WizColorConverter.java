/**
 * Utilities for converting colors and color temperatures
 *
 * The full color WiZ bulbs can produce colors and various temperatures of
 * "whites" by mixing any of the available LEDs: RGBWwarm = RGBWWCwarm = Red,
 * Green, Blue, Warm White, Cool White. When operating in full color mode, the
 * warm whites are used to increase saturation (RGBW style). Temperatures of
 * white can also be called directly as K instead of mixing cw/ww (c/w) The
 * colors and temperatures need to be converted to the HSBType/PercentType
 * supported by openHAB.
