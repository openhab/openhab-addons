# KNX Binding

The openHAB KNX binding allows to connect to [KNX Home Automation](https://www.knx.org/) installations.
Switching lights on and off, activating your roller shutters, or changing room temperatures are only some examples.

To access your KNX bus, you either need a gateway device which is connected to the KNX bus and allows computers to access the bus communication.
This can be either an Ethernet (as a Router or a Tunnel type) or a serial gateway.
The KNX binding then can communicate directly with this gateway.
Alternatively, a PC running [KNXD](https://github.com/knxd/knxd) (free open source component software) can be put in between which then acts as a broker allowing multiple clients to connect to the same gateway.
Since the protocol is identical, the KNX binding can also communicate with it transparently.

***Attention:*** With the introduction of Unit of Measurement (UoM) support, some data types have changed (see `number` channel below):

- Data type for DPT 5.001 (Percent 8bit, 0 -> 100%) has changed from `PercentType` to `QuantityType`for `number` channels (`dimmer`, `color`, `rollershutter` channels stay with `PercentType`).
- Data type for DPT 5.004 (Percent 8bit, 0 -> 255%) has changed from `PercentType` to `QuantityType`.
- Data type for DPT 6.001 (Percent 8bit -128 -> 127%) has changed from `PercentType` to `QuantityType`.
- Data type for DPT 9.007 (Humidity) has changed from `PercentType` to `QuantityType`.

Rules that check for or compare states and transformations that expect a raw value might need adjustments.
If you run into trouble with that and need some time, you can disable UoM support on binding level via the `disableUoM` parameter.
UoM are enabled by default and need to be disabled manually.
A new setting is activated immediately without restart.

## Supported Things

The KNX binding supports two types of bridges, and one type of things to access the KNX bus.
There is an _ip_ bridge to connect to KNX IP Gateways, and a _serial_ bridge for connection over a serial port to a host-attached gateway.

## Bridges

The following two bridge types are supported.
Bridges don't have channels on their own.

### Discovery

KNX IP bridges, i.e. IP interfaces, routers, and knxd instances, are discovered through mulitcast communication in the local network.
As a KNX setup is typically static, this in only done during startup of the binding.
Corresponding bridges are added to the inbox.
Additional configuration might be necessary after adding a bridge.

Note that several items per device might be created, as routers typically support routing and tunneling.
Make sure you import only one item per device.

Discovery is not available for serial bridges and device Things described below.
Discovery of IP bridges will not work without further measures if openHAB and the interface run on different network segments,
as multicast traffic is typically not forwarded.

### IP Gateway

The IP Gateway is the most commonly used way to connect to the KNX bus.
At its base, the _ip_ bridge accepts the following configuration parameters:

## Things

### _device_ Things

_basic_ Things are wrappers around arbitrary group addresses on the KNX bus.
They have no specific function in the KNX binding, except that if the _address_ is defined, the binding will actively poll the Individual Address on the KNX bus to detect that the KNX actuator is reachable.
Under normal real-world circumstances, either all devices on a bus are reachable, or the entire bus is down.
If line couplers are installed, physical device addressing might be filtered; in this case, please do not specify the addresses for devices on this line.
When _fetch_ is set to true, the binding will read out the memory of the KNX actuator in order to detect configuration data and so forth.
This is just for information and has no effect on the functionality of the binding.
It can safely be turned off to save bandwidth on the bus or avoid problems with older devices.

| Name         | Required | Description                                                                                                              | Default value                                                               |
|--------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| address      | N        | The individual device address (in 0.0.0 notation)                                                                        | -  |
| fetch        | N        | Read out the device parameters and address/communication object tables (requires the address)                            | false                                                                       |
| pingInterval | N        | Interval (in seconds) to contact the device and set the thing status based on the result (requires the address)          | 600                                                                         |
| readInterval | N        | Interval (in seconds) to actively request reading of values from the bus (0 if they should only be read once at startup) | 0                                                                           |

Different kinds of channels are defined and can be used to group together Group Addresses.
All channels of a device share one configuration parameter defined at the device level: _readInterval_, an optional parameter that indicates if the 'readable' group addresses of that Channel should be read periodically at the given interval, in seconds.
'Readable' group addresses are marked with an `<` in the group address definition of a Channel, see below.
All readable group addresses are queried by openHAB during startup.
If readInterval is not specified or set to 0, no further periodic reading will be triggered (default: 0).

#### Channel Types

Standard channels are used most of the time.
They are used in the common case where the physical state is owned by a device within the KNX bus, e.g., by a switch actuator that "knows" whether the light is turned on or off, or by a temperature sensor that reports the room temperature regularly.

Control channel types (suffix `-control`) are used for cases where the KNX bus does not own the physical state of a device.
This could be the case if, for example, a lamp from another binding should be controlled by a KNX wall switch.
When a `GroupValueRead` telegram is sent from the KNX bus to a *-control Channel, the bridge responds with a `GroupValueResponse` telegram to the KNX bus.

##### Channel Type `color`, `color-control`

| Parameter        | Description                            | Default DPT |
|------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------|
| hsb              | Group address for the color            | 232.600     |
| switch           | Group address for the binary switch    | 1.001       |
| position         | Group address brightness               | 5.001       |
| increaseDecrease | Group address for relative brightness  | 3.007       |

The `hsb` address supports DPT 232.600 (RGB), 242.600 (xyY), and 251.600 (RGBW).

Some RGB/RGBW products (e.g. MDT) use HSB values for DPT 232.600 instead of RGB.
This is supported as "vendor-specific DPT" with a value of 232.60000.

RGBW (DPT 251.600) can either be converted to HSBType, or represented by two items: a HSBType for RGB and an additional PercentType for the W channel.
Default handling for RGBW is to use separate items.
Note that this also requires two frames to be sent out separately when these elements are sent to the bus, as the binary representation uses a partially populated KNX frame.
Alternatively, a single HSB item can be used.
Conversion to a single HSBType will lose the exact setting for W, and will reconstruct it when a conversion to RGBW is required.
This option can be selected using the special DPT 251.60600.

##### Channel Type `contact`, `contact-control`

| Parameter | Description   | Default DPT |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| ga        | Group address | 1.009       |

*Attention:* Due to a bug in the original implementation, the states for DPT 1.009 are inverted (i.e., `1` is mapped to `OPEN` instead of `CLOSE`).
A change would break all existing installations and is therefore not implemented.

##### Channel Type `datetime`, `datetime-control`

| Parameter | Description   | Default DPT |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| ga        | Group address | 19.001      |

##### Channel Type `dimmer`, `dimmer-control`

| Parameter        | Description                            | Default DPT |
|------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------|
| switch           | Group address for the binary switch    | 1.001       |
| position         | Group address of the absolute position | 5.001       |
| increaseDecrease | Group address for relative movement    | 3.007       |

##### Channel Type `number`, `number-control`

| Parameter | Description   | Default DPT |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| ga        | Group address | 9.001       |

Note: The `number` channel has full support for Units Of Measurement (UoM).

Using the UoM feature of openHAB (QuantityType) requires that the DPT value is set correctly.
Automatic type conversion will be applied if required.

Incoming values from the KNX bus are converted to values with units (e.g. `23 °C`).
If the channel is linked to the correct item-type (`Number:Temperature` in this case), the display unit can be controlled by item metadata (e.g., `%.1f °F` for 1 digit of precision in Fahrenheit).
The unit is stripped if the channel is linked to a plain number item (type `Number`).

Outgoing values with unit are first converted to the unit associated with the DPT (e.g., a value of `10 °F` is converted to `-8.33 °C` if the channel has DPT 9.001).
Values from plain number channels are sent as-is (without any conversion).

##### Channel Type `rollershutter`, `rollershutter-control`

| Parameter | Description                             | Default DPT |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------|-------------|
| upDown    | Group address for relative movement     | 1.008       |
| stopMove  | Group address for stopping              | 1.010       |
| position  | Group address for the absolute position | 5.001       |

##### Channel Type `string`, `string-control`

| Parameter | Description   | Default DPT |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| ga        | Group address | 16.001      |

##### Channel Type `switch`, `switch-control`

| Parameter | Description                         | Default DPT |
|-----------|-------------------------------------|-------------|
| ga        | Group address for the binary switch | 1.001       |

#### Control Channel Types

In contrast to the standard channels above, the control channel types are used for cases where the KNX bus does not own the physical state of a device.
This could, for example, be the case if a lamp from another binding should be controlled by a KNX wall switch.
When a `GroupValueRead` telegram is sent from the KNX bus to a *-control Channel, the bridge responds with a `GroupValueResponse` telegram to the KNX bus.

##### Channel Type "switch-control"

| Parameter | Description                         | Default DPT |
|-----------|-------------------------------------|-------------|
| ga        | Group address for the binary switch | 1.001       |

##### Channel Type "dimmer-control"

| Parameter        | Description                                                                                                                                   | Default DPT |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|

| position         | Group address of the absolute position                                                                                                        | 5.001       |
| increaseDecrease | Group address for relative movement                                                                                                           | 3.007       |
| frequency        | Increase/Decrease frequency in milliseconds in case the binding should handle that (0 if the KNX device sends the commands repeatedly itself) | 0           |

##### Channel Type "rollershutter-control"

| upDown    | Group address for relative movement     | 1.008       |
| stopMove  | Group address for stopping              | 1.010       |
| position  | Group address for the absolute position | 5.001       |

##### Channel Type "contact-control"

| Parameter | Description   | Default DPT |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| ga        | Group address | 1.009       |

*Attention:* Due to a bug in the original implementation, the states for DPT 1.009 are inverted (i.e. `1` is mapped to `OPEN` instead of `CLOSE`).
A change would break all existing installations and is therefore not implemented.

##### Channel Type "number-control"

| Parameter | Description   | Default DPT |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| ga        | Group address | 9.001       |

For UoM support, see the explanations of the `number` channel.

##### Channel Type "string-control"

| Parameter | Description   | Default DPT |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| ga        | Group address | 16.001      |

##### Channel Type "datetime-control"

| Parameter | Description   | Default DPT |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| ga        | Group address | 19.001      |

#### Group Address Notation

```text
<config>="[<dpt>:][<|>]<mainGA>[[+[<]<listeningGA>][+[<]<listeningGA>..]]"
```

where parts in brackets `[]` denote optional information.

**Each configuration parameter has a `mainGA` where commands are written to and optionally several `listeningGA`s.**

`mainGA` also listens to incoming packets, unless prefixed with a `>` character.
This is recommended if you have a dedicated status group address which is added as `listeningGA`.

The optional `<` sign tells whether the group address of the datapoint accepts read requests on the KNX bus (it does, if the sign is there).
The group addresses marked with `<` are read by openHAB during startup.
Future versions might support reading from one GA only.
With `*-control` channels, the state is not owned by any device on the KNX bus, therefore no read requests will be sent by the binding, i.e. `<` signs will be ignored for them.

The element `dpt` is  highly recommended and may change to a mandatory element in future versions.
If omitted, the corresponding default value will be used (see the channel descriptions above).

## Mapping DPTs to openHAB Types

Datapoint Types (DPTs) define how the content of a KNX telegram is interpreted.

The following table is a complete list of DPTs currently supported by openHAB.
OpenHAB supports all DPTs supported by the corresponding release of the Calimero library, plus a few [specific additions](#special-dpts).

The default mapping is given, however DPTs can be overwritten.
KNX frames do not contain information about the encoding or DPT, so any DPT with a compatible byte size and a useful encoding can be used.
A good example for this are bitfields represented as String which are mapped to a DPT of DecimalType for handling in rules.
For more details, see the KNX specification (section 3.7.2, System Specifications, Interworking, Datapoint Types).

In case a missing DPT or subtype is needed, there is a good chance that a DPT of matching size and DecimalType is found.
Further DPTs and subtypes may be added later once implemented and released in the [Calimero library](https://github.com/calimero-project/calimero-core).

## Special DPTs

OpenHAB supports all DPTs supported by the corresponding release of the Calimero library.

Additional DPTs have been introduced to add functionality:

| DPT           | Description                                                 | Remark     |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| DPT 232.60000 | DPT 232.600 with HSB instead of RGB data (see below)        | read/write |
| DPT 235.001   | Composed DPT 235.001, first element ActiveEnergy (Wh)       | read only  |
| DPT 235.61001 | Composed DPT 235.001, second element Tariff (plain number)  | read only  |

## KNX Secure

> NOTE: Support for KNX Secure is partly implemented for openHAB and should be considered as experimental.

### KNX IP Secure

KNX IP Secure protects the traffic between openHAB and your KNX installation.
It **requires a KNX Secure Router or a Secure IP Interface** and a KNX installation **with security features enabled in the ETS tool**.

For _Secure routing_ mode, the so-called `backbone key` needs to be configured in openHAB.
It is created by the ETS tool and cannot be changed via the ETS user interface.
There are two possible ways to provide the key to openHAB:

- The backbone key can be extracted from Security report (ETS, Reports, Security, look for a 32-digit key) and specified in parameter `routerBackboneKey`.
- The backbone key is included in ETS keyring export (ETS, project settings, export keyring). Keyring file is configured using `keyringFile` (put it in `config\misc` folder of the openHAB installation) and also requires `keyringPassword`.

For _Secure tunneling_ with a Secure IP Interface (or a router in tunneling mode), more parameters are required.
A unique device authentication key, and a specific tunnel identifier and password need to be available.
It can be provided to openHAB in two different ways:

- All information can be looked up in ETS and provided separately: `tunnelDeviceAuthentication`, `tunnelUserPassword`.
 `tunnelUserId` is a number that is not directly visible in ETS, but can be looked up in keyring export or deduced (typically 2 for the first tunnel of a device, 3 for the second one, ...).
 `tunnelUserPasswort` is set in ETS in the properties of the tunnel (below the IP interface, you will see the different tunnels listed) and denoted as "Password".
 `tunnelDeviceAuthentication` is set in the properties of the IP interface itself; check for the tab "IP" and the description "Authentication Code".
- All necessary information is included in ETS keyring export (ETS, project settings, export keyring).
 Keyring file is configured using `keyringFile` (put it in `config\misc` folder of the openHAB installation) and `keyringPassword`.
 In addition, `tunnelSourceAddress` needs to be set to uniquely identify the tunnel in use.

### KNX Data Secure

KNX Data Secure protects the content of messages on the KNX bus.
In a KNX installation, both classic and secure group addresses can coexist.
Data Secure does _not_ necessarily require a KNX Secure Router or a Secure IP Interface, but a KNX installation with newer KNX devices that support Data Secure and with **security features enabled in the ETS tool**.

**openHAB ignores messages with secure group addresses, unless data secure is configured.**

> NOTE: openHAB currently does fully support passive (listening) access to secure group addresses.
Write access to secure group addresses is currently disabled in openHAB.
Initial/periodic read will fail, avoid automatic read (< in thing definition).

All necessary information to decode secure group addresses is included in ETS keyring export (ETS, project settings, export keyring).
Keyring file is configured using `keyringFile` (put it in `config\misc` folder of the openHAB installation) and also requires `keyringPassword`.

## Examples

The following two templates are sufficient for almost all purposes.
Only add parameters to the Bridge and Thing configuration if you know exactly what functionality it is needed for.

### Type ROUTER mode configuration Template

knx.things:

```java
Bridge knx:ip:bridge [
    type="ROUTER",
    autoReconnectPeriod=60 //optional, do not set <30 sec.
] {
    Thing device knx_device "knx_device_name" @ "knx_device_group" [
        //readInterval=3600 //optional, only used if reading values are present
    ] {
        //Items configurations
    }
}
```

### Type TUNNEL mode configuration Template

knx.things:

```java
Bridge knx:ip:bridge [
    type="TUNNEL",
    ipAddress="192.168.0.111",
    autoReconnectPeriod=60 //optional, do not set <30 sec.
] {
    Thing device knx_device "knx_device_name" @ "knx_device_group" [
        //readInterval=3600 //optional, only used if reading values are present
    ] {
        //Items configurations
    }
}
```
