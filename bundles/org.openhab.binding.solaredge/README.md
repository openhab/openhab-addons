# SolarEdge Binding

The SolarEdge binding is used to get live data from from SolarEdge inverters via the central web api. This binding should in general be compatible with all inverter models that upload data to the solaredge portal.
Only read access is supported.

## Supported Things

This binding provides only one thing type: "generic" which is the inverter itself.
As the name suggests it is generic which means it applies to all available inverters.
Create one inverter thing per physical inverter installation available in your home(s).
Additional stuff like batteries is automatically supported.
Inverters which have a meter attached allow more detailed measuring.
Either a SolarEdge modbus meter or a S0 meter (export or consumption meter) can be used.
While on the one hand the S0 meter is the cheaper solution the solaredge meter on the other hand can be used as combined import+export meter and therefore allows even more detailed measurements.
For more details please see here:

- [Avoiding Feed-In limitations with consumption meters](https://www.solaredge.com/solutions/feed-in-limitation-and-metering-solution#)

## Discovery

Auto-Discovery is not supported, as access requires authentication.

## Thing Configuration

The following configuration parameters are available for this thing:

- **tokenOrApiKey** (required)
Either the [official API Key](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iR26nmL5bXg) for using the public API or when using the inofficial private API: a token which can be retrieved from browser's cookie store when logged into the SolarEdge website.
It is called "SPRING_SECURITY_REMEMBER_ME_COOKIE".
When using this token, see also `usePrivateApi` and `meterInstalled`.
E.g. for Firefox, use the built-in [Storage Inspector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Storage_Inspector) to retrieve the token.

- **solarId** (required)  
Id of your inverter at SolarEdge (can be found in the URL after successful login: <https://monitoring.solaredge.com/solaredge-web/p/site/> **&lt;solarId&gt;** /#/dashboard)

- **usePrivateApi** (optional)  
can be set to true to use the private API.
Private API has no limit regarding query frequency but is less stable.
Private API will only gather live data if a meter is available.
The official public API has a limit of 300 queries per day but should be much more reliable/stable.
Set this to true when using token retrieved from browser in `tokenOrApiKey`.
See also `meterInstalled`. (default = false)

- **meterInstalled** (optional)  
can be set to true for setups that contain a meter which is connected to the inverter.
A meter allows more detailed data retrieval.
This must be set to true when using token retrieved from browser in `tokenOrApiKey`.
This can be set either to true or false when using the API key. (default = false)

- **liveDataPollingInterval** (optional)  
interval (minutes) in which live data values are retrieved from Solaredge.
Setting less than 10 minutes is only allowed when using private API. (default = 10)

- **aggregateDataPollingInterval** (optional)  
  interval (minutes) in which aggregate data values are retrieved from Solaredge.
  Setting less than 60 is only allowed when using private API. (default = 60)

## Channels

Available channels depend on the specific setup e.g. if a meter and/or a battery is present.
All numeric channels use the [UoM feature](https://openhab.org/blog/2018/02/22/units-of-measurement.html).
This means you can easily change the desired unit e.g. MWh instead of kWh just in your item definition.
Following channels are currently available:
