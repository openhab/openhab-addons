# Panasonic Blu-ray Player Binding

This binding connects Panasonic Blu-ray players from 2011/2012 and UHD Blu-ray players from 2018 to openHAB.
**Supported Blu-ray models:** DMP-BDT110, DMP-BDT210, DMP-BDT310, DMP-BDT120, DMP-BDT220, DMP-BDT320, DMP-BBT01 & DMP-BDT500.
**Supported UHD models:** DP-UB420/424, DP-UB820/824 & DP-UB9000/9004.

**Please note:** The player must be on the same IP subnet as the openHAB server for this binding to function.
If the connection to the player originates from a different subnet, 404 response errors are sent in response to all requests.

To enable network remote control of the Blu-ray model players, configure the following settings:
**Player Settings/Network/Network Settings/Remote Device Settings**
Then make sure you have the following values set:
**Remote Device Operation: On**
**Registration Type: Automatic**

For the UHD models, Voice Control must be enabled for the player's http interface to be active:
**Player Settings/Network/Voice Control: On**

To enable the binding to control the player while off (network active while off), Quick Start mode must be On as follows:
**Player Settings/System/Quick Start: On**

**UHD Model Command Authentication:**
The UHD models require authentication to use the control API.
A player key must be specified in the thing configuration in order for the `power`, `button` and `control` channels to work.
UHD model players that are patched do not require a player key.
See the [AVForums discussions](https://www.avforums.com/forums/blu-ray-dvd-player-multiregion-hacks.126/) of the DP-UB420/820/9000 players for more information.

## Supported Things

There are two supported thing types, which represent either a BD player or a UHD player.
A supported Blu-ray player uses the `bd-player` id and a supported UHD Blu-ray player uses the `uhd-player` id.
Multiple Things can be added if more than one player is to be controlled.

## Discovery

Auto-discovery is supported if the player can be located on the local network using UPnP.
Otherwise the thing must be manually added.

## Binding Configuration

The binding has no configuration options, all configuration is done at Thing level.

## Thing Configuration

The Thing has a few configuration parameters:

| Name      | Type    | Description                                                                                           | Default | Required |
|-----------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|----------|
| hostName  | text    | The host name or IP address of the player.                                                            | N/A     | yes      |
| refresh   | integer | Overrides the refresh interval of the player status. Minimum interval is 5 seconds.                   | 5       | no       |
| playerKey | text    | For UHD models, to enable authentication of control commands, a key for the player must be specified. | N/A     | no       |

Some notes:

- The control protocol of these players is undocumented and may not work consistently in all situations
- The UHD models only support playback elapsed time (not title total time or chapter information) reporting
- The time and chapter information is only available when playing a Blu-ray disc (not DVD or CD)
- There are reports in forum postings that not all commands work on all of the older models (i.e.: Power does not work on DMP-BDT110)
- Not all status information is available from all BD models (i.e.: playback elapsed time not reported by some models)

## Channels

The following channels are available:

| Channel ID      | Item Type   | Read/Write | Description                                                                           |
