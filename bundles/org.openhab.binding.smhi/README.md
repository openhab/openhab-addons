# Smhi Binding

This binding gets hourly and daily forecast from SMHI - the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute.
It can get forecasts for the nordic countries (Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland).

## Supported Things

The binding support only one thing-type: forecast.
The thing can be configured to get hourly forecasts for up to 24 hours, and daily forecasts for up to 10 days.

## Discovery

This binding does not support automatic discovery.

## Thing Configuration

The forecast thing needs to be configured with the latitude and longitude for the location of the forecast.
You can also choose for which hours and which days you would like to get forecasts.

| Parameter        | Description                     | Required |
|------------------|---------------------------------|----------|
| Latitude         | Latitude of the forecast        | Yes      |
| Longitude        | Longitude of the forecast       | Yes      |
| Hourly forecasts | The hourly forecasts to display | No       |
| Daily forecasts  | The daily forecasts to display  | No       |

## Channels

The channels are the same for all forecasts, but the daily forecast provides some additional aggregated values.
For the other daily forecast channels, the values are for 12:00 UTC.

The complete channel identifier is the channel group id (`hour_<offset>` or `day_<offset>`, where offset is 0 for the current hour/day
or the number of hours/days from now) + the channel id, concatenated with a `#`.

Examples:

- Temperature for the current hour: `hour_0#t`
- Total precipitation 3 days from now: `day_3#ptotal`
