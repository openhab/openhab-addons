thing-type.config.mqtt.broker.publickey.label = Public Key Hash
thing-type.config.mqtt.broker.publickey.description = If **publickeypin** is set this hash is used to verify the connection. Clear to allow a new public key pinning on the next connection attempt. If empty will be filled automatically by the next successful connection. An example input would be `SHA-256:83F9171E06A313118889F7D79302BD1B7A2042EE0CFD029ABF8DD06FFA6CD9D3`
thing-type.config.mqtt.broker.publickeypin.label = Public Key Pinning
thing-type.config.mqtt.broker.publickeypin.description = If this and SSL is set: After the next connection has been successfully established, the public key of the broker is pinned. The connection will be refused if another public key is used. Clear **publickey** to allow a new public key for the next connection attempt. This option can increase security.
thing-type.config.mqtt.broker.qos.label = Quality of Service
thing-type.config.mqtt.broker.qos.option.0 = At most once (0)
thing-type.config.mqtt.broker.qos.option.1 = At least once (1)
thing-type.config.mqtt.broker.qos.option.2 = Exactly once (2)
thing-type.config.mqtt.broker.reconnectTime.label = Reconnect Time
thing-type.config.mqtt.broker.reconnectTime.description = Reconnect time in ms. If a connection is lost, the binding will wait this time before it tries to reconnect.

# channel types config

channel-type.config.mqtt.publishTrigger.payload.label = Payload Condition
channel-type.config.mqtt.publishTrigger.payload.description = An optional condition on the value of the MQTT topic that must match before this channel is triggered.
channel-type.config.mqtt.publishTrigger.separator.label = Separator Character
channel-type.config.mqtt.publishTrigger.separator.description = The trigger channel payload usually only contains the received MQTT topic value. If you define a separator character, for example '#', the topic and received value will be in the trigger channel payload. For example: my_topic#my_received_value.
