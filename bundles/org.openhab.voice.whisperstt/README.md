# Whisper Speech-to-Text

Whisper STT Service uses [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) to perform offline speech-to-text in openHAB.
It also uses [libfvad](https://github.com/dpirch/libfvad) for voice activity detection to isolate single command to transcribe, speeding up the execution.

[Whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) is a high-optimized lightweight c++ implementation of [whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) that allows to easily integrate it in different platforms and applications.

Whisper enables speech recognition for multiple languages and dialects:

english, chinese, german, spanish, russian, korean, french, japanese, portuguese, turkish, polish, catalan, dutch, arabic, swedish,
italian, indonesian, hindi, finnish, vietnamese, hebrew, ukrainian, greek, malay, czech, romanian, danish, hungarian, tamil, norwegian,
thai, urdu, croatian, bulgarian, lithuanian, latin, maori, malayalam, welsh, slovak, telugu, persian, latvian, bengali, serbian, azerbaijani,
slovenian, kannada, estonian, macedonian, breton, basque, icelandic, armenian, nepali, mongolian, bosnian, kazakh, albanian, swahili, galician,
marathi, punjabi, sinhala, khmer, shona, yoruba, somali, afrikaans, occitan, georgian, belarusian, tajik, sindhi, gujarati, amharic, yiddish, lao,
uzbek, faroese, haitian, pashto, turkmen, nynorsk, maltese, sanskrit, luxembourgish, myanmar, tibetan, tagalog, malagasy, assamese, tatar, lingala,
hausa, bashkir, javanese and sundanese.

## Supported platforms

This add-on uses some native binaries to work.
You can find here the used [whisper.cpp Java wrapper](https://github.com/GiviMAD/whisper-jni) and [libfvad Java wrapper](https://github.com/GiviMAD/libfvad-jni).

The following platforms are supported:

- Windows10 x86_64
- Debian GLIBC x86_64/arm64 (min GLIBC version 2.31 / min Debian version Focal)
- macOS x86_64/arm64 (min version v11.0)

The native binaries for those platforms are included in this add-on provided with the openHAB distribution.

## CPU compatibility

To use this binding it's recommended to use a device at least as powerful as the RaspberryPI 5 with a modern CPU.
The execution times on Raspberry PI 4 are x2, so just the tiny model can be run on under 5 seconds.

If you are going to use the binding in a `x86_64` host the CPU should support the flags: `avx2`, `fma`, `f16c`, `avx`.
You can check those flags on linux using the terminal with `lscpu`.
You can check those flags on Windows using a program like `CPU-Z`.

If you are going to use the binding in a `arm64` host the CPU should support the flags: `fphp`.
You can check those flags on linux using the terminal with `lscpu`.

## Transcription time

On a Raspberry PI 5, the approximate transcription times are:

| model      | exec time |
| ---------- | --------: |
| tiny.bin   |      1.5s |
| base.bin   |        3s |
| small.bin  |      8.5s |
| medium.bin |       17s |


## Configuring the model

Before you can use this service you should configure your model.

You can download them from the sources provided by the [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) author:

- https://huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp
- https://ggml.ggerganov.com

You should place the downloaded .bin model in '\<openHAB userdata\>/whisper/' so the add-ons can find them.

Remember to check that you have enough RAM to load the model, estimated RAM consumption can be checked on the huggingface link.

## Using alternative whisper.cpp library

It's possible to use your own build of the whisper.cpp shared library with this add-on.

On `Linux/macOs` you need to place the `libwhisper.so/libwhisper.dydib` at `/usr/local/lib/`.

On `Windows` the `whisper.dll` file needs to be placed in any directory listed at the variable `$env:PATH`, for example `X:\\Windows\System32\`.

In the [Whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) README you can find information about the required flags to enable different acceleration methods on the cmake build and other relevant information.

Note: You need to restart openHAB to reload the library.

## Grammar

The whisper.cpp library allows to define a grammar to alter the transcription results without fine-tuning the model.

Internally whisper works by inferring a matrix of possible tokens from the audio and then resolving the final transcription from it using either the Greedy or Bean Search algorithm.
The grammar feature allows you to modify the probabilities of the inferred tokens by adding a penalty to the tokens outside the grammar so that the transcription gets resolved in a different way.

It's a way to get the smallest models to perform better over a limited grammar.

The grammar should be defined using [BNF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backusâ€“Naur_form), and the root variable should resolve the full grammar.
It allows using regex and optional parts to make it more dynamic.

This is a basic grammar example:

```BNF
root ::= (light_switch | light_state | tv_channel) "."
light_switch ::= "turn the light " ("on" | "off")
light_state ::= "set light to " ("high" | "low")
tv_channel ::= ("set ")? "tv channel to " [0-9]+
```

You can provide the grammar and enable its usage using the binding configuration.

## Configuration

Use your favorite configuration UI to edit the Whisper settings:

### Speech to Text Configuration

General options.

- **Model Name** - Model name. The 'ggml-' prefix and '.bin' extension are optional here but required on the filename. (ex: tiny.en -> ggml-tiny.en.bin)
- **Preload Model** - Keep whisper model loaded.
- **Single Utterance Mode** - When enabled recognition stops listening after a single utterance.
- **Min Transcription Seconds** - Forces min audio duration passed to whisper, in seconds.
- **Max Transcription Seconds** - Max seconds for force trigger the transcription, without wait for detect silence.
- **Initial Silence Seconds** - Max seconds without any voice activity to abort the transcription.
