# add-on
addon.ekey.name = Ekey Binding
addon.ekey.description = This Binding integrates Ekey CV-LAN UDP adapters

# thing types
thing-type.ekey.label = CV-LAN
thing-type.ekey.description = CV-LAN UDP adapter

# thing type config description
thing-type.config.ekey.ipAddress.label = IP Address
thing-type.config.ekey.ipAddress.description = IPv4 address of the eKey udp converter. A static IP address is recommended.
thing-type.config.ekey.port.label = Port
thing-type.config.ekey.port.description = The port as configured during the UDP Converter configuration. e.g. 56000
thing-type.config.ekey.protocol.label = Protocol
thing-type.config.ekey.protocol.description = Can be RARE, MULTI or HOME depending on what the system supports
thing-type.config.ekey.delimiter.label = Delimiter
thing-type.config.ekey.delimiter.description = The delimiter is also defined on the ekey UDP converter - use the ekey configuration software to determine which delimiter is used or to change it. Another option is _ (underscore)
thing-type.config.ekey.natIp.label = NAT IP
thing-type.config.ekey.natIp.description = NAT rewritten source IPv4 address of a received eKey udp packet. Can be different from the ipAddress when using NAT. (e.g. in Kubernetes)

# channel types
channel-type.ekey.userId.label = User ID
channel-type.ekey.userId.description = This indicates which user has been detected on the terminal. The value is the numerical order of the user as it was specified on the controller.
channel-type.ekey.userName.label = Username
channel-type.ekey.userName.description = Returns the ten-character-long name of the person that has been recognized on the terminal
channel-type.ekey.userStatus.label = User status
channel-type.ekey.userStatus.description = Indicates the status of the user (-1=undefined, 1=enabled, 0= disabled)
channel-type.ekey.fingerId.label = Finger ID
channel-type.ekey.fingerId.description = Indicates which finger has been detected on the terminal. (0-9,-1)
channel-type.ekey.keyId.label = Key ID
channel-type.ekey.keyId.description = Indicates which of the four keys was used. See ekey documentation on "keys".
channel-type.ekey.fsSerial.label = Serialnumber
channel-type.ekey.fsSerial.description = This returns the 4-character-long name that was specified on the controller for the specific terminals
channel-type.ekey.fsName.label = Terminal Name
channel-type.ekey.fsName.description = This returns the terminal name
channel-type.ekey.action.label = Action
channel-type.ekey.action.description = Indicates whether access was granted (value=0) or denied (value=-1). According to the ekey documentation there are six more values possible
channel-type.ekey.inputId.label = Input ID
channel-type.ekey.inputId.description = Indicates which of the four digital inputs was triggered. Value is number of Input. "-1" indicates that no input was triggered.
channel-type.ekey.relayId.label = Relay ID
channel-type.ekey.relayId.description = Indicates which relay has been switched.
channel-type.ekey.termId.label = Terminal ID
channel-type.ekey.termId.description = This provides the serial number of the packet source. The source can be a fingerprint terminal or the controller (in case of digital inputs). The Serial number has a length of 13. 
channel-type.ekey.reserved.label = Reserved
channel-type.ekey.reserved.description = Reserved
channel-type.ekey.event.label = Event
channel-type.ekey.event.description = Event
