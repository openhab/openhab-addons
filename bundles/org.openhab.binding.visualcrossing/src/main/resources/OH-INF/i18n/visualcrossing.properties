action.description.dateFrom = Is the start date for which to retrieve weather data. If a date2 value is also given, then it represents the first date for which to retrieve weather data. If no date2 is specified then weather data for a single day is retrieved, and that date is specified in date1. All dates and times are in local time of the location specified. Dates should be in the format yyyy-MM-dd. For example 2020-10-19 for October 19th, 2020 or 2017-02-03 for February 3rd, 2017. Instead of an exact date, you can specify a <a href= "https://www.visualcrossing.com/resources/documentation/weather-api/using-the-time-period-parameter-to-specify-dynamic-dates-for-weather-api-requests/">dynamic date period</a>.

You can also request the information for a specific time for a single date by including time into the date1 field using the format yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss. For example 2020-10-19T13:00:00.The results are returned in the 'currentConditions' field and are truncated to the hour requested (i.e. 2020-10-19T13:59:00 will return data at 2020-10-19T13:00:00).
action.description.dateTo = Is the end date for which to retrieve weather data. This value may only be used when a date1 value is given. When both date1 and date2 values are given, the query is inclusive of date2 and the weather data request period will end on midnight of the date2 value.
