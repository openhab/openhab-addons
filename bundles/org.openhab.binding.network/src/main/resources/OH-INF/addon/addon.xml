		<parameter name="allowSystemPings" type="boolean">
			<default>true</default>
			<label>Allow System Pings</label>
			<description>Allows or disallows to use system pings next to the java integrated ping functionality.
				On windows the
				system ping works more reliable most of the time.</description>
		</parameter>
		<parameter name="allowDHCPlisten" type="boolean">
			<default>true</default>
			<label>Listen for DHCP Requests</label>
			<description>Usually a device requests an IP address in an IPv4 network with the help of DHCP as soon as it enters a
				network. If we listen to those
				packets, we can detect a device presence even faster. You need elevated access rights
				(see readme) for this to work.</description>
		</parameter>
		<parameter name="cacheDeviceStateTimeInMS" type="integer" unit="ms">
			<default>2000</default>
			<label>Cache Time</label>
			<description>The result of a device presence detection is cached for a small amount of time. Be aware that no new
				pings will be issued within this time frame, even if explicitly requested.</description>
			<advanced>true</advanced>
		</parameter>
		<parameter name="arpPingToolPath" type="text">
			<default>arping</default>
			<label>ARP Ping Tool Path</label>
			<description>If your arp ping tool is not called arping and cannot be found in the PATH environment, you can
				configure the absolute path / tool name here.</description>
		</parameter>
		<parameter name="preferResponseTimeAsLatency" type="boolean">
			<default>false</default>
			<label>Use Response Time as Latency</label>
			<description>If enabled, an attempt will be made to extract the latency from the output of the ping command. If no
				such latency value is found in the ping command output, the time to execute the ping command is used as fallback
				latency. If disabled, the time to execute the ping command is always used as latency value.</description>
