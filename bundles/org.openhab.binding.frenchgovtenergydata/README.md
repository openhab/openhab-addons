# French Government Energy Data Binding

This binding provides regulated electricity prices in France.

This can be used to plan energy consumption, for example to calculate the cheapest period for running a dishwasher or charging an EV.

## Supported Things

The binding offers things for the two usual tariff classes (proposed by example by EDF).

- `base`: This is the basic subscription with a fixed kWh price.
- `hphc`: Alternative subscription offering variable price in a given hour set (low hours/high hours).
- `tempo`: Alternative suscription with different price in regards of day colors and day or night.
    Day colors can be Red, White or Blue. 
    Red day are the one where there is most energy demands in France, and are the most higher price.
    White day are intermediate pricing, for day where energy demands is not almost important as red day.
    Blue day are the one with the lower price.

    Blue day, and in some proportion White day get very interesting discount in regards of base tariff.
    But Red day, in counter part, have very high rate during the daylight.

## Thing Configuration

Things (both `base`, `hphc` and `tempo`) only offers the configuration of the power output of the electrical delivery point (Linky terminal).
