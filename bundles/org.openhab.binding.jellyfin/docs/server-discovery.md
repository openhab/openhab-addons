# Jellyfin Server Discovery

## Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the server discovery process for Jellyfin servers in the openHAB Jellyfin binding.
For architectural context, see [architecture.md](./architecture.md).

## Discovery Workflow

The binding automatically discovers available Jellyfin servers on the local network.
The process is designed to be seamless and requires no manual configuration from the user.

    Wait --> Parse["Parse responses and extract server details"]
    Parse --> Register["Register discovered servers in openHAB inbox"]
    Register --> End([End])
```

- The binding sends a broadcast message on the local network to discover Jellyfin servers.
- Jellyfin servers respond with their details.
- The binding parses these responses and extracts relevant information (e.g., server name, address).
- Discovered servers are registered in the openHAB inbox for easy setup.
