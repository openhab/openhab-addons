/**
 * The {@link RemoteSensorDTO} represents a sensor connected to the thermostat.
 * The remote sensor data will only show computed occupancy, as does the thermostat.
 * Definition - For a given sensor, computed occupancy means a sensor is occupied
 * if any motion was detected in the past 30 minutes. RemoteSensor data changes
 * trigger the runtimeRevision to be updated. The data updates are sent at an
 * interval of 3 mins maximum. This means that you should not poll quicker
 * than once every 3 mins for revision changes.
