/**
 * The update sensor function allows the caller to update the name of an ecobee3 remote sensor.
 * Each ecobee3 remote sensor "enclosure" contains two distinct sensors types temperature
 * and occupancy. Only one of the sensors is required in the request. Both of the sensors'
 * names will be updated to ensure consistency as they are part of the same remote sensor
 * enclosure. This also reflects accurately what happens on the Thermostat itself. Note: This
 * function is restricted to the ecobee3 thermostat model only.
