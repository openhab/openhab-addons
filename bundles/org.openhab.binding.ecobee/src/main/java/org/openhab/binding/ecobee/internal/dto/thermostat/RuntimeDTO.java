/**
 * The {@link RuntimeDTO} represents the last known thermostat running state. This state
 * is composed from the last interval status message received from a thermostat. It is
 * also updated each time the thermostat posts configuration changes to the server.
 * The runtime object contains the last 5 minute interval value sent by the thermostat
 * for the past 15 minutes of runtime. The thermostat updates the server every 15 minutes
 * with the last three 5 minute readings. The actual temperature and humidity will also
 * be updated when the equipment state changes by the thermostat, this may occur at a
 * frequency of 3 minutes, however it is only transmitted when there is an equipment
 * state change on the thermostat. The runtime object contains two fields, desiredHeatRange
 * and desiredCoolRange, which can be queried and used to determine that any holds being
 * set through the API will not be adjusted. The API caller should check these ranges
 * before calling the setHold function to mitigate against the new set points being
 * adjusted by the server if the values are outside the acceptable ranges.
