/**
 * The {@link ExtendedRuntimeDTO} contains the last three 5 minute interval values
 * sent by the thermostat for the past 15 minutes of runtime. The interval values
 * are valuable when you are interested in analyzing the runtime data in a more
 * granular fashion, at 5 minute increments rather than the more general 15 minute
 * value from the Runtime Object. For the runtime values (i.e. heatPump, auxHeat,
 * cool, etc.) refer to the Thermostat.Settings values (hasHeatPump, heatStages,
 * coolStages) to determine whether a heat pump exists and how many stages the
 * thermostat supports. The actual temperature and humidity will also be updated
 * when the equipment state changes by the thermostat, this may occur at a frequency
 * of 3 minutes, however it is only transmitted when there is an equipment state
 * change on the thermostat.
