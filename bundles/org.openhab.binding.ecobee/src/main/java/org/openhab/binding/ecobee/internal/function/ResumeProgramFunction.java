/**
 * The resume program function removes the currently running event providing the event
 * is not a mandatory demand response event. The top active event is removed from the
 * stack and the thermostat resumes its program, or enters the next event in the stack
 * if one exists. This function may need to be called multiple times in order to resume all
 * events. Sending 3 resume functions in a row will resume the thermostat to its program
 * in all instances. Note that vacation events cannot be resumed, you must delete the
 * vacation event using the DeleteVacationFunction.
