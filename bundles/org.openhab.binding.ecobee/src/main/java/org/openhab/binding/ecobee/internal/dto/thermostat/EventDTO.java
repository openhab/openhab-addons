/**
 * The {@link EventDTO} represents a scheduled thermostat
 * program change. All events have a start and end time during which the
 * thermostat runtime settings will be modified. Events may not be directly
 * modified, various Functions provide the capability to modify the calendar
 * events and to modify the program. The event list is sorted with events
 * ordered by whether they are currently running and the internal priority
 * of each event. It is safe to take the first event which is running and
 * show it as the currently running event. When the resume function is used,
 * events are removed in the order they are listed here.
