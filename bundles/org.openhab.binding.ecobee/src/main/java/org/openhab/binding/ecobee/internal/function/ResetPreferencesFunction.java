 * The reset preferences function sets all of the user configurable settings back to

 * thermostat settings such as hvacMode, lastServiceDate and vent, but also all of
 * the user configurable fields of the thermostat.settings and thermostat.program
 * objects. Note that this does not reset all values. For example, the installer
 * settings and wifi details remain untouched.
