# Asuswrt Binding

This binding adds support to read information from ASUS-Routers (Copyright Â© ASUS).

## Discovery

The ASUS routers are discovered through UPnP in the local network.
After adding a discovered router it is required to configure the username and password to use it.

## Supported Things

This binding supports ASUS routers with Asuswrt or [Asuswrt-Merlin](https://www.asuswrt-merlin.net/) firmware.
Firmware 5.x.x (some DSL models) is NOT supported (not Asuswrt).
