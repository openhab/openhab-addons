# Miele@home Binding

This binding integrates Miele@home appliances.
Miele@home allows controlling Miele appliances that are equipped with special communication modules.
There are devices that communicate through Zigbee and others that use WiFi.

See [www.miele.de](https://www.miele.de) for the list of available appliances.

## Supported Things

This binding requires the XGW3000 gateway from Miele as all integration with openHAB is done through this gateway.
While users with Zigbee-enabled Miele appliances usually own such a gateway, this is often not the case for people that have only WiFi-enabled appliances.

The types of appliances that are supported by this binding are:

- Coffeemachine
- Dishwasher
- Fridge
- Fridge/Freezer combination
- Hob
- Hood
- Oven
- Microwave/Oven combination
- Tumbledryer
- Washingmachine

## Discovery

The binding is able to auto-discover the Miele XGW3000 gateway.
When an XGW3000 gateway is discovered, all appliances can be subsequently discovered.

### Note on Discovery

The XGW3000 gateway is sometimes a few seconds late in re-announcing itself on the network.
This means that it might repeatedly disappear from, and re-appear in, the Inbox.
To avoid this, there is a discovery configuration parameter `removalGracePeriod` which delays such Inbox disappearances.
The default value is 15 seconds.
If you want to change this value just add the following line to your `$OPENHAB_CONF/services/runtime.cfg` file.

```ini
discovery.miele:removalGracePeriod=30
```

### Thing Configuration for Miele XGW3000

| Configuration Parameter | Description                                                                                                                      |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ipAddress               | Network address of the Miele@home gateway                                                                                        |
| interface               | Network address of openHAB host interface where the binding will listen for multicast events coming from the Miele@home gateway. |
| userName                | Name of a registered Miele@home user.                                                                                            |
| password                | Password for the registered Miele@home user.                                                                                     |
| language                | Language for state, program and phase texts. Leave blank for system language.                                                    |

### Thing Configuration for appliance

| Configuration Parameter | Description                                              |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| uid                     | Unique identifier for specific appliance on the gateway. |

Each appliance needs the device UID as a configuration parameter.
The UID is nowhere to be found on the appliances, but since the discovery works quite reliably, a manual configuration is not needed.

## Channels

### Raw values

Some channels represent raw/numeric values for state, program and phase, namely rawState, rawProgram and rawPhase.
These channels are more reliable as rule triggers/logic than using their text-based counterparts. Raw values are
always available from the gateway even when texts are missing. Only a subset of available raw values are documented
here since no official documentation exists.
