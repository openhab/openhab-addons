	<description>
		This is the binding for SEMSPortal. The SEMS portal is where a GoodWE solar installation uploads it's
		data. The SEMS portal has a lot of data, only a few of them are currently mapped to a channel.
		You will need an account
		at semsportal.com and have your solar installation registered on that account.
