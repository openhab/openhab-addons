# Govee Lan-API Binding

![govee](doc/govee-lights.png)

This binding integrates Light devices from [Govee](https://www.govee.com/).
Even though these devices are widely used, they are usually only accessable via the Cloud.
Another option is using Bluetooth which, due to its limitation only allows to control devices within a small range.
The Bluetooth approach is supported by the openHAB Govee Binding while this binding covers the LAN interface.

Fortunately, there is a [LAN API](https://app-h5.govee.com/user-manual/wlan-guide) that allows to control the devices within your own network without accessing the Cloud.
Note, though, that is somehow limited to a number of devices listed in the aforementioned manual.
The binding is aware of all the devices that are listed in that document and even provides a product description during discovery.

Note: By intent the Cloud API has not been implemented (so far) as it makes controlling Govee devices dependent by Govee service itself.

## Supported Things

The things that are supported are all lights.
While Govee provides probably more than a hundred different lights, only the following are supported officially by the LAN API, even though others might works as well.

## Discovery

Discovery is done by scanning the devices in the Thing section.

The devices _do not_ support the LAN API support out-of-the-box.
To be able to use the device with the LAN API, the following needs to be done (also see the "Preparations for LAN API Control" section in the [Goveee LAN API Manual](https://app-h5.govee.com/user-manual/wlan-guide)):

- Start the Govee APP and add / discover the device (via Bluetooth) as described by the vendor manual
  Go to the settings page of the device
  ![govee device settings](doc/device-settings.png)
- Note that it may take several(!) minutes until this setting comes up.
- Switch on the LAN Control setting.
- Now the device can be used with openHAB.
- The easiest way is then to scan the devices via the SCAN button in the thing section of that binding

## Thing Configuration

Even though binding configuration is supported via a thing file it should be noted that the IP address is required and there is no easy way to find out the IP address of the device.
One possibility is to look for the MAC address in the Govee app and then looking the IP address up via:

```shell
arp -a | grep "MAC_ADDRESS"
```

### `govee-light` Thing Configuration

# Troubleshooting

In case nothing is discovered

- please check if all devices are set to LAN-Mode
- ping the following address `ping 239.255.255.250`.
  You should get a response for every Govee Device on your LAN
- In case you get a result, add the device via the manual option

## Additional Information

Please provide any feedback regarding unlisted devices that even though not mentioned herein do work.
