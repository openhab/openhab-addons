# Shelly Binding

This Binding integrates [Shelly devices](https://shelly.cloud) developed by Allterco.

Allterco provides a rich set of smart home devices. All of them are WiFi enabled (2,4GHz, IPv4 only) and provide a documented API.
The binding is officially acknowledged by Allterco and openHAB is listed as a reference and directly supports the openHAB community.

The binding controls the devices independently from the Allterco Shelly Cloud (in fact it can be disabled).
The binding co-exists with Shelly App for Smartphones, Shelly Device Web UI, Shelly Cloud, MQTT and other 3rd party Apps.

The binding focuses on reporting the device status and device control.
Initial setup and device configuration has to be performed using the Shelly Apps (Web UI or Smartphone App).
The binding gets in sync with the next status refresh.

Refer to [Advanced Users](doc/AdvancedUsers.md) for more information on openHAB Shelly integration, e.g. firmware update, network communication or log filtering.

Also check out the [Shelly Manager](doc/ShellyManager.md), which

- provides detailed information on your Shellys
- helps to diagnose WiFi issues or device instabilities
- includes some common actions and
- simplifies firmware updates.

[Shelly Manager](doc/ShellyManager.md) could also act as a firmware upgrade proxy - the device doesn't need to connect directly to the Internet, instead openHAB services as a download proxy, which improves device security.

## Supported Devices

The binding supports both hardware generations

- Generation 1: The original Shelly devices like the Shelly 1, Shelly 2.5, Shelly Flood etc.
- Generation 2+3: Plus / Pro series of devices
- Shelly Plus Mini: Shelly Plus devices in compact format (Gen 2+3)
- Shelly BLU: Bluetooth based series of devices

The binding provides the same feature set across all devices as good as possible and depending on device specific features.

`Note:` Using BLU devices or the Plus/Pro Range Extender mode require some additional configuration steps.
See section [Discovery](#discovery) for details.

### Special Thing Types

| thing-type        | Model                                                  | Vendor ID |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
| shellydevice      | A password protected Shelly device or an unknown type  |           |
| shellyunknown     | An unknown Shelly device / model has been detected     |           |

## Binding Configuration

The binding has the following configuration options:

### Generation 1

| Parameter       | Description                                                         | Mandatory | Default |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | ------- |
| defaultUserId   | Default user id for HTTP authentication when not set in the Thing   | no        | admin   |
| defaultPassword | Default password for HTTP authentication when not set in the Thing  | no        | admin   |
| autoCoIoT       | Auto-enable CoIoT events when firmware 1.6+ is enabled (Gen1 only). | no        | true    |

`defaultUserId` and `defaultPassword:` will be used by the binding if device protection is enabled.
However, the Plus/Pro devices have a fixed user id admin`. Nevertheless the binding provide that option to allow a mixed operation of Gen 1 and 2 devices in the same installation having same defaults.

`Generation 1`: The binding defaults to CoIoT events when firmware 1.6 or newer is detected.
CoIoT provides near-realtime updates on device status changes.

This mode also overrules event settings in the Thing configuration.
Disabling this feature allows granular control, which event types will be used.
This is also required when the Shelly devices are not located on the same IP subnet (e.g. using a VPN).
In this case autoCoIoT should be disabled, CoIoT events will not work, because the underlying CoAP protocol is based on Multicast IP, which usually doesn't passes a VPN or routed network.

## Firmware

`Generation 1`: The binding requires firmware version 1.9.2 or newer to enable all features.
`Generation 2+3` Those Shelly devices require firmware version 1.0.0 or newer (1.10.0+ is recommended).
`Shelly BLU deries`: Use the Shelly App to update to 1.0+ version of the firmware.

Some of the features are enabled dynamically or are not available depending on device type and firmware release.
The Web UI of the Shelly device displays the current firmware version under Settings:Firmware and shows an update option when a newer version is available.

The current firmware version is reported in the Thing Properties.
A dedicated channel indicates the availability of a newer firmware (`device#updateAvailable`, not available for BLU devices).
Use the device's Web UI or the Shelly App to perform the update.

Check [Advanced Users](doc/AdvancedUsers.md) for information how to update your device.

Once you have updated the device **you should delete and re-discover** the openHAB Thing.
This makes sure that the Thing is correctly initialized and all supported channels are created.
openHAB will restore the channel/item linkage from the previous configuration, there is no need to re-create those manually.

## Discovery

In general devices need to be active to be discovered by the binding.
Battery powered devices need to wake up by pressing the button, they will stay active for a minute or so, which gives you enough time to start the discovery.

The binding uses mDNS to discover the Shelly devices.
They periodically announce their presence, which is used by the binding to find them on the local network.
Sometimes you need to run the manual discovery multiple times until you see all your devices.

`Important for Generation 1 Devices`:
It's strongly recommended to enable CoIoT in the device settings for faster response times (event driven rather than polling).
Open the device's Web UI, section "COIOT settings" and select "Enable COCIOT".
It's recommended to switch the Shelly devices to CoAP peer mode if you have only your openHAB system controlling the device.
This allows routing the CoIoT/CoAP messages across multiple IP subnets without special network setup required.
You could use Shelly Manager (doc/ShellyManager.md) to easily do the setup (configuring the openHAB host as CoAP peer address).
Keep Multicast mode if you have multiple hosts, which should receive the CoAP updates.

### Discovery of BLU Devices

The BLU devices use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).
The binding can't communicate directly with the device, so a Shelly Plus/Pro device is required with enabled Bluetooth to use those devices as a hub.
The binding automatically installs a script on the Shelly Device (oh-blu-scanner.js), which forwards the BLU events to the binding.

Follow these steps to add the Shelly BLU Device to openHAB

- Make sure a Shelly is near by the BLU device, enable Bluetooh on this device (**disable the 'Bluetooth Gateway' mode** in the Shelly app/UI is recommended)
- Add this thing to openHAB, make sure thing gets online
- Enable "BLU Gateway Support" in the thing configuration of the Shelly device acting as gateway.
- Now press the button on your BLU device, this wakes up the device and the script forwards this event to the binding
- As a result the corresponding thing should show up in the Inbox
- Add the thing (at this point no channels are created), the new thing will show status CONFIG_PENDING
- Click the device button again, the binding gets another event and creates the channels and thing changes status to ONLINE
- Finally link the channels to the equipment in the model

`Note`:

- During initialization the script 'oh-blu-scanner.js' gets installed and activated on the Shelly Gateway device.
- Shelly BLU Motion: It may take some time until channels like Lux show up.

Try moving the device to force status updates.

Every time an event is received sensors#lastUpdate and channels are updated with the reported values.
`device#wifiSignal` indicates the Bluetooth signal strength and gets updated when the device sends an event.

The binding supports multiple Shelly Plus/Pro as gateway devices unless they are added as thing and are ONLINE.
In this scenario the channel `device#gatewayDevice` will report the last hub device, which forwarded a status update.

### Password Protected Devices

The Shelly devices can be configured to require authorization through a user id and password.
In this case you need to set these values in the Thing configuration after approving the Inbox entry.

If you have multiple devices protected by the same credentials it's recommended to set the default user id and password in the binding configuration BEFORE running the discovery.
In this case the binding could directly access the device to retrieve the required information using those credentials.
Otherwise a Thing of type shellyprotected is created in the Inbox and you could set the credentials while adding the Thing.
In this case the credentials are persisted as part of the Thing configuration.

### Range Extender Mode

The Plus/Pro devices support the so-called Range Extender Mode (not available for Gen1). 
This allows connect Shellys, which are normally no reachable, because of a lack of WiFi signal.
Once enabled the Shelly acts as a hub to the linked devices, like a WiFi repeater.
The hub device enables the access point, which can be seen by the linked device.
The binding could then get access to the secondary device using &lt;ub shelly ip&gt;:&lt;special port&gt;.
A special port on the hub device will be created for every linked device so one hub device could supported multiple linked devices.


The binding communicates with the Shelly hub device, which then forwards the request to the secondary device.
Once the thing for the primary Shelly goes online the binding detects the enabled range extender mode and adds all connected secondary devices to the Inbox.
This means: The primary Shelly has to complete initialization before linked secondary devices are discovered.

- Discover primary/hub Shelly
- Add thing and wait until it goes ONLINE
- Check Inbox to find the secondary/linked devices
- Add secondary device as usual

If you are adding another secondary device to the same hub device you need to suspend and resume the primary thing, this will run a new initialization and adds the new secondary device to the Inbox.

### Dynamic creation of channels

The Shelly series of devices has many combinations of relays, meters (different versions), sensors etc.
For this the binding creates various channels dynamically based on the status information provided by the device at initialization time.
If a channel is missing make sure the Thing was discovered correctly and is ONLINE.
If a channel is missing delete the Thing and re-discover it.
Creation of those channels takes about 5-10sec, maybe you need to reload the page to update the browser status.

### Important for battery powered devices

Make sure to wake up battery powered devices, so that they show up on the network.
The Shelly Button 1 needs to be connected to USB, other devices like Flood have a push button inside.
For those open the case, press that button and the LED starts flashing.
Wait a moment and then start the discovery. The device should show up in the Inbox and can be added.
Sometimes you need to run the discovery multiple times.

### Roller Favorites

Firmware 1.9.2+ for Shelly 2.5 and 0.11+ for Plus 2PM in roller mode supports so called roller favorites for positions.
You could use the Shelly App to setup 4 different positions (percentage) and assign id 1-4.
The channel `roller#rollerFav` allows to select those from openHAB and the roller moves to the desired position.
In the Thing configuration you could also configure an id when the `roller#control` channel receives UP or DOWN.
Values 1-4 are selecting the corresponding favorite id in the Shelly App, 0 means no favorite.

### Thing Status

The binding sets the following Thing status depending on the device status:

| Status                | Description                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| INITIALIZING          | This is the default status while initializing the Thing. Once the initialization is triggered the Thing switches to Status ONLINE.CONFIGURATION_PENDING. |
| UNKNOWN               | Indicates that the status is currently unknown, which must not show a problem. Once the device is reachable and was initialized the Thing switches to status ONLINE. |
| CONFIGURATION_PENDING | The Thing has been initialized, but device initialization is in progress or pending (e.g. waiting for device wake-up).       |
| ONLINE                | ONLINE indicates that the device can be accessed and is responding properly. Once initialized battery powered devices also stay ONLINE when in sleep mode. The binding has an integrated watchdog timer supervising the device, see below. The Thing switches to status OFFLINE when some type of communication error occurs.        |
| OFFLINE               | Communication with the device failed. Check the Thing status in the UI and openHAB's log for an indication of the error.     |
| COMMUNICATION_ERROR   | Communication with the device has reported an error, check detailed status. If the problem persists make sure to have stable WiFi, set the correct password etc. Try restarting OH or deleting and re-discovering the Thing. |
| FIRMWARE_UPDATING     | Device firmware is updating, just wait. The device should come back to ONLINE within 2 minutes.                              |
| DUTY_CYCLE            | The device is re-initializing and reported a restart event, e.g. after a firmware update or manual reboot.                   |

`Note:`
For more details see  [Thing Concept](https://www.openhab.org/docs/concepts/things.html#status-details) in openHAB documentation.

`Battery powered devices:`
If the device is in sleep mode and can't be reached by the binding, the Thing will change into CONFIG_PENDING.
Once the device wakes up, the Thing will perform initialization and the state will change to ONLINE.

The first time a device is discovered and initialized successfully, the binding will be able to perform auto-initialization when OH is restarted.  Waking up the device triggers the a status report (CoIoT packet for event url for Gen1 and WebSocket call for Gen2), which is processed by the binding and triggers initialization. Once a device is initialized, it is no longer necessary to manually wake it up after an openHAB restart unless you change the battery. In this case press the button and run the discovery again.

### Device Watchdog

The binding supervises availability of the device once it becomes ONLINE by sending periodic status requests to the device. The watchdog is restarted when the device is responding properly.

Communication errors are handled depending on the device type:

- regular power devices change to OFFLINE, because this status indicates an error
- battery powered devices stay ONLINE, because usually the device is in sleep mode

The binding also monitors that the device is responding at least once within a given time period.
The period is computed depending on the device type and configuration:

- battery  powered devices: &lt;sleepPeriod from device config&gt; + 10min, usually 12h+10min=730min
- else, if CoIoT or WebSocket is enabled: 3*&lt;update Period from device settings&gt;+10sec, usually3*15+10=45sec
- else 2*60+10sec = 130sec

Once the timer expires the device switches to OFFLINE and the bindings starts to re-initialize the device periodically.

You could also create a rule to catch those status changes or device alarms (see rule examples).

Availability of channels is depending on the device type.
The binding detects many of those channels on-the-fly (when Thing changes to ONLINE state) and adjusts the Thing's channel structure.
The device must be discovered and ONLINE to successfully complete this process.
The accumulated channels are only available for devices with more than 1 meter. accumulatedReturned only for the EM and 3EM.
The LED channels are available for the Plug-S with firmware 1.6x and for various other devices with firmware 1.8 or newer. The binding detects them automatically.

## Events

### Generation 1: Action URLs vs. CoIoT

Depending on the firmware release the Shelly devices supports 2 different mechanims to report sensor updates or events.

1. Action URLs
    Usually the binding polls the device to update the status and maps the returned values to the various channels.
    In addition the binding can register so-called Action URLs. Those events are triggered by the device to report special events.
    You need to disable autoCoIoT in the binding configuration to make specific selections for the Action events.

    The following event types could be registered when enabled in the Thing configuration:

    | Event Type         | Description                                                                                                                 |
    | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | eventsButton       | This event is triggered when the device is in button mode. The device reports the ON/OFF status of the button.              |
    | eventsSwitch       | This event reports the status of the relay output. This could change by the button or API calls.                            |
    | eventsPush         | The device reports the short/longpush events when in  button mode momentary, momentary_on_release, one_button or two_button |
    | eventsSensorReport | Sensor devices (like H&T) provide sensor updates when this action URL is enabled.                                           |

    Important: The binding defaults to CoIoT when firmware 1.6 or newer is detected.
    This has significant experience improvements and also prevents interfering with other applications, because the device only supports one set of Action URLs.
1. CoIoT / CoAP
    Starting with version 1.6 the devices reports most status values via the CoIoT protocol.
    CoIoT provides near-realtime updates and better event support.
    Firmware 1.7 adds additional status values, also supported by the binding.
    Version 1.8 introduces CoIoT version 2, which fixes various issues with version 1 and provides almost all relevant status updates.

    If there is no specific reason you should enable CoIoT.
    Check section Network Settings [here](doc/AdvancedUsers.md) for more information.

    Enable the autoCoIoT option in the binding configuration or eventsCoIoT in the Thing configuration to activate CoIoT.

### Generation 2: WebSockets

The Plus and Pro series of devices use WebSockets for device communication.
Usually the binding establishes a WebSocket connection to the device (http port 80).
However, battery powered devices like the Plus HT are not reachable while the device is in sleep mode.
For those the binding sets up a so called "Outbound WebSocket" during device initialization.
Afterwards the device wakes up and calls the configured URL, which is the processed by the binding.
The device UI shows the URL when active.
Battery powered devices could only report events to a single host, take care if you have multiple openHAB instances on the same network.

### Button events

Various devices signal an event when the physical button is pressed.
This could be a switch connected to the SW input of the relay or the Button 1 or 2.

The following trigger types are sent:

| Event Type         | Description                                                         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SHORT_PRESSED      | The button was pressed once for a short time (lastEvent=S)          |
| DOUBLE_PRESSED     | The button was pressed twice with short delay (lastEvent=SS)        |
| TRIPLE_PRESSED     | The button was pressed three times with short delay (lastEvent=SSS) |
| LONG_PRESSED       | The button was pressed for a longer time (lastEvent=L)              |
| SHORT_LONG_PRESSED | A short followed by a long button push (lastEvent=SL)               |
| LONG_SHORT_PRESSED | A long followed by a short button push (lastEvent=LS)               |

Check the channel definitions for the various devices to see if the device supports those events.
You could use the Shelly App to set the timing for those events.

If you want to use those events triggering a rule:

- If a physical switch is connected to the Shelly use the input channel(`input` or `input1`/`input2`) to trigger a rule
- For a momentary button use the `button` trigger channel as trigger, channels `lastEvent` and `eventCount` will provide details on the event

### Alarms

The binding provides health monitoring functions for the device.
When an alarm condition is detected the channel alarm gets triggered and provides one of the following alarm types:

A new alarm will be triggered on a new condition or every 5 minutes if the condition persists.

### Non-battery powered devices

| Event Type   | Description                                                                       |

Note: The `meter`for the Shelly 1L is kind of fake.
It doesn't have a real power meter, but you could setup an estimated consumption in the Shelly App, e.g. 60W if you have attached a good old light bulb to the output channel.
In this case the is no real measurement based on power consumption, but the Shelly reports the configured value when the relay is ON.

### Shelly 3EM (thing-type: shellyem3)

Please note: The product is called Shelly 3EM whereas the device propagates the service under shellyem3.
The Thing id is derived from the service name, so that's the reason why the Thing is named shelly**em3** and not shelly3em.

### Shelly 2.5 - relay mode (thing-type:shelly25-relay)

The Shelly 2.5 includes 2 meters, one for each channel.
Firmware 1.9.2 or newer is required to use the roller position favorites, which are defined in the Shelly App.

### Shelly 2.5 - roller mode (thing-type: shelly25-roller)

The Shelly 2.5 includes 2 meters, one for each channel.
However, it doesn't make sense to differ power consumption for the roller moving up vs. moving down.
For this the binding aggregates the power consumption of both relays and includes the values in "meter1".

`Note: The Dimmer should be calibrated using the device Web UI or Shelly App.`

Using the Thing configuration option `brightnessAutoOn` you could decide if the light is turned on when a brightness > 0 is set.
`true`:  Brightness will be set and device output is powered = light turns on with the new brightness
`false`: Brightness will be set, but output stays unchanged so light will not be switched on when it's currently off.

Note: The openHAB color picker has only values for red/green/blue (RGB), not for white as supported by the RGBW2.
Beside channel `hsb` the binding also offers the `white` channel (hsb as only RGB values).
Or control each color separately with channels `red`, `blue`, `green` (those are advanced channels).

Using the Thing configuration option `brightnessAutoOn` you could decide if the light is turned on when a brightness > 0 is set.
`true`:  Brightness will be set and device output is powered = light turns on with the new brightness
`false`: Brightness will be set, but output stays unchanged so light will not be switched on when it's currently off.

Please note that the settings of channel group color are only valid in color mode and vice versa for white mode.
The current firmware doesn't support the timestamp report for the meters.
The binding emulates this by using the system time on every update.

In white mode each RGBW2 channel is defined as DimmableLight.
This means that the brightness channel has 2 functions

- Sending ON/OFF (OnOffType) to power on/off the channel
- Sending a Number to set the brightness (percentage 0..100)

Sending brightness 0 will automatically turn off the channel if it's currently on.
Sending brightness > 0 will automatically turn on the channel if it's currently off.
You can define 2 items (1 Switch, 1 Number) mapping to the same channel, see example rules.

Use case for the 'sensorSleepTime':
You have a Motion controlling your light.
You switch off the light and want to leave the room, but the motion sensor immediately switches light back on.
Using 'sensorSleepTime' you could suppress motion events while leaving the room, e.g. for 5sec and the light doesn's switch on.

`Note: The Dimmer should be calibrated using the device Web UI or Shelly App.`

Using the Thing configuration option `brightnessAutoOn` you could decide if the light is turned on when a brightness > 0 is set.
`true`:  Brightness will be set and device output is powered = light turns on with the new brightness
`false`: Brightness will be set, but output stays unchanged so light will not be switched on when it's currently off.

### shelly.rules

#### Catch alarms

```java
rule "Monitor Shelly Restart"
when
    Channel "shelly:shelly2-relay:XXXXXX:device#alarm" triggered OVERTEMP
then
        logInfo("Shelly1", "Device is getting to hot!!")
end
```

#### Trigger scene with Button-1

```java
rule "Button-1 SHORT_PRESSED"
when
    Channel "shelly:shellybutton1:d8f15bXXXXXX:status#button" triggered SHORT_PRESSED
then
    logInfo("Button", "Shelly Button reported SHORT_PRESSED")
    if (MyTV.state != OFF) {
        logInfo("Button", "   switch TV OFF")
        sendCommand(MyTV, "OFF")
    } else {
        logInfo("Button", "   switch TV to ON")
        sendCommand(MyTV, ON)
    }
end

rule "Button-1 TRIPLE_PRESSED"
when
    Channel "shelly:shellybutton1:d8f15bXXXXXX:status#button" triggered TRIPLE_PRESSED
then
    logInfo("Button", "Shelly Button reported TRIPLE_PRESSED")
end
```

#### Observe battery status

pre-requisites:

- Install Send Mail Action
- Define a group called gBatteries
'Group   gBattery        "Batterien"         <battery>       (All)'
- Link battery channel for all your Shelly battery powered devices
- Add battery items to group gBattery

```java
val String mailTo     = "alarm@openhab.me"

/* ------------- Battery Monitor ----------- */

rule "Battery Monitor"
when
    System started or
    Time cron "0 0 10 * * ?"
then
    logInfo("BatteryMon", "Check Battery state")

    if (! gBattery.allMembers.filter([state < lowBatteryThreshold]).empty) {
        message = "Battery levels:\n"

        var report = gBattery.allMembers.filter([ state instanceof DecimalType ]).sortBy([ state instanceof DecimalType ]).map[ 
        name + ": " + state.format("%d%%\n") ]
        message = message + report

        message = message + "\nBattery Level:\n"
        gBattery?.allMembers.forEach([sw|
            message = message + sw.name + ": " + state.format("%d%%\n")
        ])

        sendMail(mailTo, "Home: LOW Battery Alert!", message)
    }
    logInfo("BatteryMon", "Batteries checked.")
end
```

#### Control CCT LED stripes

Usage & Requirements:

- 4 Items per Thing required. Example:

```java
Group     gCCT_LED        "All CCT LEDs"
Dimmer    LED1_brightness     "Brightness"    (gCCT_LED)
Dimmer    LED1_temperature    "Temperature"   (gCCT_LED)
Dimmer    LED1_cw         "cold white Channel"
Dimmer    LED1_ww         "warm white Channel"
```

- Items "LED1" and "LED1_temperature" are proxy items and to be used in sitemaps. Both have to be a member of group "gCCT_LED"
- Items "LED1_cw" and "LED_ww" are items linked to Thing channel. Not required in sitemaps. Do NOT include in this group
- Prefix: needs to be constant per Thing.

```java
val String strSuffixSeparator = "_"             //Separator: 1 unique separator
val String strSuffixBrightness = "brightness"           //Suffix: at your choice
val String strSuffixTemperature = "temperature"         //Suffix: at your choice

rule "CCT_LED"
when
    Member of gCCT_LED changed
then
    logInfo("CCT_LED", "Item '{}' received command {}",triggeringItem.name,triggeringItem.state)
    var Number iNewCwState     //New value for cold white channel
    var Number iNewWwState     //New value for warm white channel
    val String strThing = triggeringItem.name.toString.split(strSuffixSeparator).get(0)     //Get Name of "Thing", i.e. LED1 or LED2 or...
    val String strType = triggeringItem.name.toString.split(strSuffixSeparator).get(1)      //Get Type (brightness oder temperature)

    if ((strType == strSuffixBrightness) && (triggeringItem.state as Number) == 0) {        //no math required. just switch off
        iNewCwState = 0
        iNewWwState = 0
    }
    else {
        var iBrightness = gCCT_LED.members.findFirst[ t | t.name == strThing+strSuffixSeparator+strSuffixBrightness ].state as Number
        var iColor = gCCT_LED.members.findFirst[ t | t.name == strThing+strSuffixSeparator+strSuffixTemperature ].state as Number
        logInfo("CCT_LED", "Setting 'Brightness' to {} and 'White Color' to {}",iBrightness,iColor)
        iNewWwState = Math::round ((iColor / 100 * iBrightness).intValue)
        iNewCwState = iBrightness - iNewWwState
    }
    logInfo("CCT_LED", "Changing channel 'Cold White' to {} and 'Warm White' to {}",iNewCwState,iNewWwState)
    sendCommand(strThing + "_cw", iNewCwState.toString)
    sendCommand(strThing + "_ww", iNewWwState.toString)
end
```

#### Reading colors from Color Picker:

```java
import org.openhab.core.library.types.*

rule "Get input change from garage light"
when
    Item Shelly_XXXXX3_Input changed to ON
then
    logInfo("Garage", "Light input is ON")
    BackDoorLight.sendCommand(ON)
end

rule "Momentary Switch events"
when
    Channel "shelly:shellydevice:XXXXXX:relay1#button" triggered SHORT_PRESSED
then
    logInfo("Relay", "A short push was detected")
end


rule "Shelly alarms"
when
    Channel "shelly:shellydevice:XXXXXX:device#alarm"       triggered or
    Channel "shelly:shelly25-roller:XXXXXX:device#alarm"    triggered
then
    if (receivedEvent !== null) { // A (channel) event triggered the rule
        eventSource = triggeredChannel
        eventType = receivedEvent
        ...
    } 
end

rule "Color changed" 
when
    Item ShellyColor changed
then
    var HSBType hsbValue = ShellyColor.state as HSBType
    var int redValue = hsbValue.red.intValue
    var int greenValue = hsbValue.green.intValue
    var int blueValue = hsbValue.blue.intValue
end
