# Shelly Manager

The Shelly Manager is a small extension to the binding, which provides some low level information on the Shelly Devices, but also provides some functions to manage the devices.

To open the Shelly Manage launch the following URL in your browser
- http://&lt;openHAB IP address&gt;:8080/shelly/manager or
- http://&lt;openHAB IP address&gt;:8443/shelly/manager

Maybe you need to change the port matching your setup.

Shelly Manager makes you various device insights available to get an overview of your Shellys
- Get a quick overview that all Shellys operate like expected, statistical data will help to identify issues
- Have some basic setting actions integrated, which help to do an easy setup of new Shellys added to openHAB
- Make firmware updates way easier - filter 'Update available' + integrated 2-click update
- Provide a firmware download proxy, which allows to separate your Shellys from the Internet (improved device security)

## Overview

Once the Shelly Manager is opened an overview of all Shelly devices added as a Thing are displayed. 
Things which are not discovered or still site in the Inbox will not be displayed.

![](images/manager/overview.png)

You'll see a bunch of technical details, which are not available as channels or in the Thing properties.
This includes information on the device communication stability. 
The statistic gives you a good overview if device communication is stable or a relevant number of timeouts need to be recovered.
In this case you should verify the WiFi coverage or other options to improve stability.

The following information is available

### Device Filters
|Filter              |Description                                                                      |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------| 
|All                 |Clear filter / display all devices                                               |
|Online only         |Filter on devices with Thing Status = ONLINE                                     |
|Inactive only       |Filter on devices, which are not initialized for in Thing Status = OFFLINE       |
|Needs Attention     |Filter on devices, which need attention (setup/connectivity issues), see below   |
|Update available    |Filter on devices having a new firmware version available                        |
|Unprotected         |Filter on devices, which are currently not password protected                    |

Beside the Device Filter box you see a refresh button.
At the bottom right you see number of displayed devices vs. number of total devices.
A click triggers a background status update for all devices rather only the selected one when clicking of the refresh button in the device lines.

Filter 'Needs Attention':
This is a dynamic filter, which helps to identify devices having some kind of setup / connectivity or operation issues.
The binding checks the following conditions
- Thing status != ONLINE: Use the 'Inactive Only' filter to find those devices, check openhab.log
- WIFISIGNAL: WiFi signal strength < 2 - this usually leads into connectivity problems, check positioning of portable devices or antenna direction.
- LOWBATTERY: The remaining battery is < 20% (configuration in Thing Configuration), consider to replace the battery 
Watch out for bigger number of timeout errors.
- Device RESTARTED: Indicates a firmware problem / crash if this happens without a device reboot or firmware update (timestamp is included)
- OVERTEMP / OVERLOAD / LOADERROR: There are problems with the physical installation of the device, check specifications, wiring, housing!
- SENSORERROR: A sensor error / malfunction was detected, check product documentation
- NO_COIOT_DISCOVERY: The CoIoT discovery has not been completed, check IP network configuration, re-discover the device
- NO_COIOT_MULTICAST: The CoIoT discovery could be completed, but the device is not receiving CoIoT status updates.
You might try to switch to CoIoT Peer mode, in this case the device doesn't use IP Multicast and sends updates directly to the openHAB host.

The result is shown in the Device Status tooltip.

## Firmware Update

The Shelly Manager simplifies the firmware update.
You could select between different versions using the drop down list on the overview page.

Shelly Manager integrates different sources
- Allterco official releases: production and beta release (like in the device UI)
- Older firmware release from the firmware archive - this is a community service
- You could specify any custom URL providing the firmware image (e.g. a local web server), which is accessible for the device using http

| | |
|-|-|
|![](images/manager/overview_versions.png)|All firmware releases are combined to the selection list.<br/>Click on the version you want to install and Shelly Manager will generate the requested URL to trigger the firmware upgrade.|

The upgrade starts if you click "Perform Update".

![](images/manager/fwupgrade.png)

The device will download the firmware file, installs the update and restarts the device.
Depending on the device type this takes between 10 and 60 seconds.
The binding will automatically recover the device with the next status check (as usual).

### Connection types

You could choose between 3 different update types
* Internet: This triggers the regular update; the device needs to be connected to the Internet
* Use openHAB as a proxy: In this case the binding directs the device to request the firmware from the openHAB system.
The binding will then download the firmware from the selected sources and passes this transparently to the device.
This provides a security benefit: The device doesn't require Internet access, only the openHAB host, which could be filtered centrally.
* Custom URL: In this case you could specify 

The binding manages the download request with the proper download URL.
