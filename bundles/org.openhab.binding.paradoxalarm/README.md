# Paradox Alarm System binding

This binding is intended to provide basic support for Paradox Alarm system.

With the power of openHAB this binding can be used for complex decision rules combining motion/magnetic sensor or whole partitions states with different scenarios.

Examples:

- All partitions are armed, therefore there is no one at home.
- Window is opened for more than 10 minutes and temperature outside is bellow XXX degrees, send mail/any other supported notification to particular people.

## Supported Paradox panels/systems

Currently binding supports the following panels: EVO192, EVO48(not tested), EVO96(not tested)

## Supported things

| Thing      | Thing Type | Description                                                    |
|------------|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| ip150      | Bridge     | The bridge is used to communicate with IP150 ethernet module attached to Paradox security system.|
| panel      | Thing      | This is representation of Paradox panel. Has the general information about the main panel module, i.e. serial number, firmware/hardware/software versions, panel type, etc...|
| partition  | Thing      | The partition is grouped aggregation of multiple zones. It's also referred in Paradox Babyware as "Area". |
| zone       | Thing      | Paradox zone. Can be anything - magnetic, motion or any other opened/closed sensor. State channel is contact, "low battery" and "is tampered" channels are switch, label is String |

## Things configuration

### IP150 bridge parameters

| Parameter         | Description                            |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| refresh           | Value is in seconds. Defines the refresh interval when the binding polls from paradox system. Optional parameter. Default 5 seconds.|
| ip150Password     | The password to your IP150 (not your panel PIN). Mandatory parameter.  |
| pcPassword        | The panel programming code 3012 setting. Optional parameter. Default value is 0000.|
| ipAddress         | IP address or hostname of your IP150. If hostname is used must be resolvable by OpenHAB. Mandatory parameter.  |
| port              | The port used for data communication. Optional parameter. Default value is 10000.|
| panelType         | If parameter is passed, auto-discovery of panel type will be skipped. Provide string - EVO48, EVO96, EVO192, etc... Optional parameter. |
| reconnectWaitTime | Value is in seconds. The time to wait before a reconnect occurs after socket timeout. Optional parameter. Default value is 30 seconds.|
| maxPartitions     | Sets maximum partitions to use during refresh. If not set, maximum allowed amount from panelType will be used. Optional parameter. |
| maxZones          | Sets maximum zones to use during refresh. If not set, maximum allowed amount from panelType will be used. Optional parameter.|
| encrypt           | Sets if encryption has to be used. Optional parameter. Default value is false |

### IP150 bridge channels

| Channel             | Description                                    |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|
|communicationCommand | Possible values [LOGOUT, LOGIN, RESET]         |
|communicationState   | Shows the communication status to Paradox. Different from Bridge status. Bridge may be online and able to receive commands but communication may be offline due to various reasons. Possible values [Offline, Online] |

#### Communication command channel allowed values

| Value  | Description                                                                        |
|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| LOGOUT | Logs out and disconnects from Paradox alarm system                                 |
| LOGIN  | Creates socket if necessary, connects to paradox system and uses the logon data from the thing parameters to connect.|
| RESET  | Does logout and then login with recreation of communicator objects inside the code.|

### Entities (zones, partitions) configuration parameters:

| Value             | Description                                                                        |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| id                | The numeric ID of the zone/partition                                               |
| disarmEnabled     | Optional boolean flag. Valid for partitions. When set to true the command DISARM will be allowed for the partition where the flag is enabled. CAUTION: Enabling DISARM command can be dangerous. If attacker can gain access to your openHAB (via API or UI), this command can be used to disarm your armed partition (area) |
