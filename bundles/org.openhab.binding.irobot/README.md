# iRobot Binding

This binding provides integration of products by iRobot company (<https://www.irobot.com/>). It is currently developed
to support Roomba vacuum cleaner/mopping robots with built-in Wi-Fi module. The binding interfaces to the robot directly
without any need for a dedicated MQTT server.

## Supported Things

- iRobot Roomba robotic vacuum cleaner (<https://www.irobot.com/roomba>).
- iRobot Braava has also been reported to (partially) work.
- In general, the channel list is far from complete. There is a lot to do now.

## Discovery

Roombas on the same network will be discovered automatically, however in order to connect to them a password is needed.
The password is a machine-generated string, which is unfortunately not exposed by the original iRobot smartphone application, but it can be downloaded from the robot itself.
If no password is configured, the Thing enters "CONFIGURATION PENDING" state.
Now you need to perform authorization by pressing and holding the HOME/DOCK button on your robot until it plays series of tones (approximately 2 seconds).
The Wi-Fi indicator on the robot will flash for 30 seconds, the binding should automatically receive the password and go ONLINE.

After you've done this procedure you can write the password somewhere in case if you need to reconfigure your binding.
It's not known, however, whether the password is eternal or can change during factory reset.
If you have issues getting the password make sure there are no other devices like your smartphone communicating with the robot.
You can also try using [these python scripts](https://github.com/NickWaterton/Roomba980-Python) to get the password.

**NOTE:** For file-based configuration, storing the password is essential.
Once the password for the Thing is populated in the Code tab in the UI, you must copy that into the [config files](#irobotthings-example) in order for it to persist.
Without this, the Roomba will appear to work temporarily.
However, as soon as the Things file is edited, the password will be lost, and the button will need to be pressed again.

## Thing Configuration

| Parameter | Type    | Required  | Default  | Description       |
| --------- | :-----: | :-------: | :------: | ----------------- |
| ipaddress | String  | Yes       |          | Robot IP address  |

| password  | String  | No        |          | Robot Password    |

All parameters will be autodiscovered. If using textual configuration, then `ipaddress` shall be specified.

## Cleaning specific regions

You can clean one or many specific regions of a given map by sending the following String to the command channel:

```text
cleanRegions:<pmapId>;[r=]<region_id1>,[r=]<region_id2>,z=<zone_id1>,...;[<user_pmapv_id>]
```

Some devices support cleaning rooms (aka regions). Additionally, support for cleaning rectangle areas previously defined in the iRobot-App (aka zones) may be available.
If the type string such as `r=` (region) or `z=` (zone) is omnitted, the type defaults to region.

The easiest way to determine the pmapId, region_ids/zoneids and userPmapvId is to monitor the last_command channel while starting a new mission for the specific region or zone with the iRobot-App.

## Known Problems / Caveats

1. Sending "pause" command during missions other than "clean" is equivalent to sending "stop"
1. Switching to "spot" mission is possible only in "stop" state. Attempt to do it otherwise causes error: the command is rejected and error tones are played.
1. Roomba's built-in MQTT server, used for communication, supports only a single local connection at a time. Bear this in mind when you want to do something that requires local connection from your phone, like reconfiguring the network. Disable openHAB Thing before doing this.
1. Sometimes during intensive testing Roomba just stopped communicating over the local connection. If this happens, try rebooting it. On my robot it's done by holding "Clean" button for about 10 seconds until all the LEDs come on. Release the button and the reboot tone will be played. It looks like there are some bugs in the firmware.

## Example

### `irobot.things` Example

```java
Thing irobot:roomba:my_roomba [ ipaddress="192.168.0.5", password="xxxxxxxx" ]
```

### `irobot.items` Example

```java
String Roomba_Command { channel="irobot:roomba:my_roomba:command" }
String Roomba_Cycle { channel="irobot:roomba:my_roomba:cycle" }
String Roomba_Phase { channel="irobot:roomba:my_roomba:phase" }
Number Roomba_Battery { channel="irobot:roomba:my_roomba:battery" }
String Roomba_Bin { channel="irobot:roomba:my_roomba:bin" }
String Roomba_Error { channel="irobot:roomba:my_roomba:error" }
```

### `irobot.sitemap` Example

```perl
Selection item=Roomba_Command mappings=["clean"="Clean", "spot"="Spot", dock="Dock", pause="Pause", stop="Stop"]
Text item=Roomba_Cycle label="Current cycle"
Text item=Roomba_Phase label="Current phase"
Text item=Roomba_Battery label="Battery charge [%d %%]"
Text item=Roomba_Bin label="Bin status"
Text item=Roomba_Error label="Error"
```
