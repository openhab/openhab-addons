# Home Connect Binding

The binding integrates the [Home Connect](https://www.home-connect.com/) system into openHAB.
By using the Home Connect API it connects to household devices from brands like Bosch and Siemens.

Because all status updates and commands have to go through the API, a permanent internet connection is required.

## Supported Things

### Bridge

The **Home Connect API** (Bridge Type ID: api_bridge) is responsible for the communication with the Home Connect API. All devices use a bridge to execute commands and listen for updates. Without a working bridge the devices cannot communicate.

### Devices

Supported devices: dishwasher, washer, washer / dryer combination, dryer, oven, refrigerator freezer, coffee machine, hood, cooktop*

#### experimental support

| Home appliance | Thing Type ID |

## Thing Configuration

### Configuring the **Home Connect API** Bridge

#### 1. Preconditions

1. Please create an account at [Home Connect](https://www.home-connect.com/) and add your physical appliance to your account.
1. Test the connection to your physical appliance via mobile app ([Apple App Store (iOS)](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/home-connect-app/id901397789?mt=8) or [Google Play Store (Android)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bshg.homeconnect.android.release)).

#### 2. Create Home Connect developer account

1. Create an account at [https://developer.home-connect.com](https://developer.home-connect.com) and login.
1. Please make sure you've added your associated Home Connect account email at <https://developer.home-connect.com/user/me/edit>. You should fill in your email address, which you use for the official Android or iOS app, at `Default Home Connect User Account for Testing`.
![Screenshot Home Connect profile page](doc/home_connect_profile.png "Screenshot Home Connect profile page")
1. Register / Create an application at [https://developer.home-connect.com/applications](https://developer.home-connect.com/applications)
    - _Application ID_: e.g. `openhab-binding`
    - _OAuth Flow_: Authorization Code Grant Flow
    - _Home Connect User Account for Testing_: the associated user account email from [Home Connect](https://www.home-connect.com/)
       > **WARNING**: Please don't use your developer account username

    - _Redirect URIs_: add your openHAB URL followed by `/homeconnect`
    for example: `http://192.168.178.34:8080/homeconnect` or `https://myhome.domain.com/homeconnect`
    - _One Time Token Mode_: keep unchecked
    - _Proof Key for Code Exchange_: keep unchecked

       > **NOTE**: You might get an error (`403 - Forbidden`) in case you entered a bare IP of your local openHAB instance. In that case, use your instance's hostname instead (e.g. for openhabian `http://openhabian:8080/homeconnect`) and try again.

1. After your application has been created, you should see the _Client ID_ and _Client Secret_ of the application. Please save these for later.

![Screenshot Home Connect application page](doc/home_connect_application.png "Screenshot Home Connect application page")

#### 3. Setup bridge (openHAB UI)

The Home Connect bridge can be configured in the openHAB UI as follows:

1. Go to the Inbox and press the add button
1. Choose `Home Connect Binding`
1. Select `Home Connect API`
1. Setup and save thing
    - **client id:** your application client id
    - **client secret:** your application client secret
    - **simulator:** false
1. Now navigate to the URL (`Redirct URI`) you've added to your Home Connect application in the previous step (2.3). For example `http://192.168.178.80:8080/homeconnect`.
1. Please follow the steps shown to authenticate your binding. You can redo this step every time. For example if you have authentication problems, just start wizard again.
![Screenshot Home Connect wizard page 1](doc/homeconnect_setup_1.png "Screenshot Home Connect wizard page 1")
![Screenshot Home Connect wizard page 2](doc/homeconnect_setup_2.png "Screenshot Home Connect wizard page 2")
![Screenshot Home Connect wizard page 3](doc/homeconnect_setup_3.png "Screenshot Home Connect wizard page 3")
![Screenshot Home Connect wizard page 4](doc/homeconnect_setup_4.png "Screenshot Home Connect wizard page 4")
1. That's it! Now you can use autodiscovery to add devices. Your devices should show up if you start a device scan in the openHAB UI.

## Examples: File based configuration

If you prefer to configure everything via file instead of openHAB UI, here are some examples. In order to get your `haId` you might use the discover feature in UI, copy the appliance's ID and paste it into your `*.things`.

## Home Connect Console

The binding comes with a separate user interface, which is reachable through the web browser http(s)://[YOUROPENHAB]:[YOURPORT]/homeconnect (e.g. `http://192.168.178.100:8080/homeconnect`).

Features:

- overview of your bridges and appliances
- send commands to your appliances
- see latest API requests
- see received events from the Home Connect backend
- API request counts

> **INFO**: If you have a problems with your installation, please always provide request and event exports. ![Screenshot Home Connect wizard page 4](doc/export_button.png "Export button")

## How To

### Notification on credential error

To get notified when your Home Connect credentials have been revoked or expired you can use the following rule to get notified.

This can happen if

- your openHAB instance was offline for a longer period or
- new terms weren't accepted or
- a technical problem occurred.

```java
rule "Offline check - Home Connect bridge"
when
    Thing "<thingUID>" changed
then
    val statusInfo = getThingStatusInfo("<thingUID>")
    val status = statusInfo.getStatus()
    val statusDetail = statusInfo.getStatusDetail()

    if ((status !== null) && (statusDetail !== null)) {
        logInfo("api_bridge", "Home Connect bridge status: " + status.toString() + " detail: " + statusDetail.toString())
        if (status.toString() == 'OFFLINE' && statusDetail.toString() == 'CONFIGURATION_PENDING') {
            logError("api_bridge", "Home Connect bridge offline.")
            // send push, email, ...
        }
    }
end
```

### Start program with custom settings

Currently, not all program options of a device are available as items in openHAB. For example, you cannot change the `Fill quantity` of a coffee maker program. If you wish to start a program with a custom setting, you can send a special command to the item of type `basic_actions_state`.

> **INFO**: Only for advanced users. You need to know how to use the `curl` command. Alternatively you you can use the binding UI to trigger the commands.

#### 1. Retrieve "special command" payload

You have a couple options to get the program settings payload.

a) You could have a look at the Home Connect developer documentation (<https://developer.home-connect.com/docs/>) and create the payload on your own.

b) You could have a look at the request logs and extract the payload from there.

1. On the physical device, select your desired program with the appropriate options.
1. Open the appliance section of the binding UI (http(s)://[YOUROPENHAB]:[YOURPORT]/appliances) and click the 'Selected Program' button.
![Screenshot Home Connect wizard page 4](doc/selected_program_1.png "Get selected program")
1. ![Screenshot Home Connect wizard page 4](doc/selected_program_2.png "Get selected program") Copy the JSON payload. In a further step, this payload will be used to start the program.

#### 2. Start program

After you've extracted the desired program command, you can start your program via openHAB rule or through a `curl` command.

##### in rule

_Example rule:_

```java
rule "trigger program"
when
    Time cron "0 32 13 ? * * *"
then
    homeconnect_CoffeeMaker_BOSCH_HCS06COM1_B95E5103934D_basic_actions_state.sendCommand('{"data":{"key":"ConsumerProducts.CoffeeMaker.Program.Beverage.EspressoMacchiato","options":[{"key":"ConsumerProducts.CoffeeMaker.Option.CoffeeTemperature","value":"ConsumerProducts.CoffeeMaker.EnumType.CoffeeTemperature.94C","unit":"enum"},{"key":"ConsumerProducts.CoffeeMaker.Option.BeanAmount","value":"ConsumerProducts.CoffeeMaker.EnumType.BeanAmount.Mild","unit":"enum"},{"key":"ConsumerProducts.CoffeeMaker.Option.FillQuantity","value":60,"unit":"ml"}]}}')
end
```

Please replace `homeconnect_CoffeeMaker_BOSCH_HCS06COM1_B95E5103934D_basic_actions_state` with your item name (of channel type `basic_actions_state`).

##### via curl

_Example command:_

```shell
curl -X POST --header "Content-Type: text/plain" --header "Accept: application/json" -d '{"data":{"key":"ConsumerProducts.CoffeeMaker.Program.Beverage.EspressoMacchiato","options":[{"key":"ConsumerProducts.CoffeeMaker.Option.CoffeeTemperature","value":"ConsumerProducts.CoffeeMaker.EnumType.CoffeeTemperature.94C","unit":"enum"},{"key":"ConsumerProducts.CoffeeMaker.Option.BeanAmount","value":"ConsumerProducts.CoffeeMaker.EnumType.BeanAmount.Mild","unit":"enum"},{"key":"ConsumerProducts.CoffeeMaker.Option.FillQuantity","value":60,"unit":"ml"}]}}' "http://localhost:8080/rest/items/homeconnect_CoffeeMaker_BOSCH_HCS06COM1_B95E5103934D_basic_actions_state"
```

Please replace `homeconnect_CoffeeMaker_BOSCH_HCS06COM1_B95E5103934D_basic_actions_state` with your item name (of channel type `basic_actions_state`).

### How to avoid having to re-authorize the bridge after a new openHAB installation

OAuth is storing data in two files: your access tokens in the file `userdata/jsondb/StorageHandler.For.OAuthClientService.json` and the encryption/decryption key in the file `userdata/config/SymmetricKeyCipher.config`.
Consider backing up and restoring these two files when installing a new openHAB server from scratch.
Otherwise, all you need to do is re-authorize your bridge.

## FAQ

### I can't switch remote start to on.

The channel of type `remote_start_allowance_state` is read only. You can only enable it directly on the physical appliance.

### In case of error...

Please check log UI (http(s)://[YOUROPENHAB]:[YOURPORT]/homeconnect) and ask for help in the community forum or on github. Please provide request and event exports.
 ![Screenshot Home Connect wizard page 4](doc/export_button.png "Export button")

### Rate limit reached

The Home Connect API enforces rate [limits](https://developer.home-connect.com/docs/general/ratelimiting). If you have a lot of `429` response codes in your request log section (http(s)://[YOUROPENHAB]:[YOURPORT]/homeconnect/log/requests), please check the error response.

### Error message 'Program not supported', 'Unsupported operation' or 'SDK.Error.UnsupportedOption'

Not all appliance programs and program options are supported by the Home Connect API. Unfortunately you can't use them. You will see error messages like the following in the binding UI (request log):

```json
{
  "error": {
    "key": "SDK.Error.UnsupportedProgram",
    "description": "Unsupported operation: LaundryCare.Washer.Program.Cotton.CottonEco"
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "error": {
    "key": "SDK.Error.UnsupportedProgram",
    "description": "Program not supported"
  }
}
```

### How to find the Home Appliance ID (HaID) of my device?

You have two options to find the right HaID of your device.

1. You can use the openHAB UI and start a scan. ![Screenshot openHAB UI Scan for new devices](doc/ui-scan-for-haid.png "Scan")
1. You can use Home Connect binding UI. Please have a look at the first API request. ![Screenshot Home Connect Binding UI](doc/binding-ui-haid.png "First request")
