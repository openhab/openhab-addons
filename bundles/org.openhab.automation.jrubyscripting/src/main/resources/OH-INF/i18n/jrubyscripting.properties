automation.config.jrubyscripting.bundle_gemfile.description = Path to your own Gemfile relative to <code>OPENHAB_CONF/automation/ruby/</code>. An absolute path can be used. If this file exists, the <code>gems</code> setting above will be ignored, so your Gemfile must include <code>openhab-scripting</code> to use the helper library.
automation.config.jrubyscripting.check_update.label = Check for Gem Updates
automation.config.jrubyscripting.check_update.description = Check RubyGems for updated gems when OpenHAB starts or JRuby settings are changed. Otherwise it will try to fulfill the requirements with locally installed gems, and you can manage them yourself with either the <code>jrubyscripting gem</code> or <code>jrubyscripting bundle</code> console commands, or an external Ruby by setting the same GEM_HOME.
automation.config.jrubyscripting.console.label = Console Script
automation.config.jrubyscripting.console.description = The script file to be required by the <code>jrubyscripting console</code> console command. When specified without any path, <code>openhab/console/</code> will be prepended.

Defaults to "<code>OPENHAB_CONF/automation/ruby/.gem/{RUBY_ENGINE_VERSION}</code>" when not specified.
automation.config.jrubyscripting.gems.label = Ruby Gems
automation.config.jrubyscripting.gems.description = A comma separated list of Ruby Gems to install. Versions may be constrained by separating with an <code>=</code> followed by standard RubyGems version constraint, such as "<code>openhab-scripting=~>5.0</code>".
