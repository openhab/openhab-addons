# IntelliCenter2 Binding

_Give some details about what this binding is meant for - a protocol, system, specific device._

_If possible, provide some resources like pictures (only PNG is supported currently), a video, etc. to give an impression of what can be done with this binding._
_You can place such resources into a `doc` folder next to this README.md._

_Put each sentence in a separate line to improve readability of diffs._

## Supported Things

_Please describe the different supported things / devices including their ThingTypeUID within this section._
_Which different types are supported, which models were tested etc.?_
_Note that it is planned to generate some part of this based on the XML files within ```src/main/resources/OH-INF/thing``` of your binding._

- `bridge`: Short description of the Bridge, if any
- `sample`: Short description of the Thing with the ThingTypeUID `sample`

## Discovery

_Describe the available auto-discovery features here._
_Mention for what it works and what needs to be kept in mind when using it._

## Binding Configuration

_If your binding requires or supports general configuration settings, please create a folder ```cfg``` and place the configuration file ```<bindingId>.cfg``` inside it._
_In this section, you should link to this file and provide some information about the options._
_The file could e.g. look like:_

```
# Configuration for the IntelliCenter2 Binding
#
# Default secret key for the pairing of the IntelliCenter2 Thing.
# It has to be between 10-40 (alphanumeric) characters.
# This may be changed by the user for security reasons.
secret=openHABSecret
```

_Note that it is planned to generate some part of this based on the information that is available within ```src/main/resources/OH-INF/binding``` of your binding._

_If your binding does not offer any generic configurations, you can remove this section completely._

## Thing Configuration

_Describe what is needed to manually configure a thing, either through the UI or via a thing-file._
_This should be mainly about its mandatory and optional configuration parameters._

_Note that it is planned to generate some part of this based on the XML files within ```src/main/resources/OH-INF/thing``` of your binding._
