## Discovery

The discovery will automatically detect your DIRIGERA Gateway via mDNS.
If it cannot be found check your router for IP address.
Manual scan isn't supported.

After successful creation of DIRIGERA Gateway and pairing process connected devices are automatically added to your INBOX.
You can switch off the automatic detection in [Bridge configuration](#bridge-configuration).   

**Before adding the bridge** read [Pairing section](#gateway-pairing).   

Devices connected to this bridge will be detected automatically unless you don't switch it off in [Bridge Configuration](#bridge-configuration)

## Gateway Bridge

### Bridge Configuration

| Name            | Type    | Description                                                | Explanation                                                                          | Default | Required |
|-----------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|----------|
| `ipAddress`     | text    | DIRIGERA IP Address                                        | Use discovery to obtain this value automatically or enter it manually if known       | N/A     | yes      |
| `id`            | text    | Unique id of this gateway                                  | Detected automatically after successful pairing                                      | N/A     | no       |
| `discovery`     | boolean | Configure if paired devices shall be detected by discovery | Run continuously in the background and detect new, deleted or changed devices        | true    | no       |

### Gateway Pairing

First setup requires pairing the DIRIGERA gateway with openHAB.
You need physical access to the gateway to finish pairing so ensure you can reach it quickly.

Let's start pairing

1. Add the bridge found in discovery 
2. Pairing started automatically after creation!
3. Press the button on the DIRIGERA rear side
4. Your bridge shall switch to ONLINE 

### Gateway Channels

| Channel         | Type      | Read/Write | Description                                  |
|-----------------|-----------|------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `pairing`       | Switch    | RW         | Sets DIRIGERA hub into pairing mode          |
| `location`      | Location  | R(W)       | Location in lat.,lon. coordinates            |
| `sunrise`       | DateTime  | R          | Date and time of next sunrise                |
| `sunset`        | DateTime  | R          | Date and time of next sunset                 |
| `statistics`    | String    | R          | Several statistics about gateway activities  |

Channel `location` can overwrite GPS position with openHAB location, but it's not possible to delete GPS data.
See [Gateway Limitations](#gateway-limitations) for further information.

### Follow Sun

<img align="right" height="150" src="doc/follow-sun.png">

[Motion Sensors](#motion-sensor) can be active all the time or follow a schedule.
One schedule is follow the sun which needs to be activated in the IKEA Home smart app in _Hub Settings_.

## Things

With [DIRIGERA Gateway Bridge](#gateway-bridge) in place things can be connected as mentioned in the [supported things section](#supported-things).
Things contain generic [configuration](), [properties]() and [channels]() according to their capabilities.

### Generic Thing Configuration

Each thing is identified by a unique id which is mandatory to configure.
Discovery will automatically identify the id.

| Name              | Type    | Description                         | Default | Required |
|-------------------|---------|-------------------------------------|---------|----------|
| `id`              | text    | Unique id of this device / scene    | N/A     | yes      |

### Generic Thing Properties

Each thing has properties attached for product information.
It contains information of hardware and firmware version, device model and manufacturer.
Device capabilities are listed in `canReceive` and `canSend`. 

<img align="center" width="500" src="doc/thing-properties.png">

### Generic Thing Channels

#### OTA Channels

Over-the-Air (OTA) updates are common for many devices. 
If device is providing these channels is detected during runtime.

| Channel         | Type      | Read/Write | Description                                  | Advanced |
|-----------------|-----------|------------|----------------------------------------------|----------|
| `ota-status`    | Number    | R          | Over-the-air overall status                  |          |
| `ota-state`     | Number    | R          | Over-the-air current state                   |    X     |
| `ota-progress`  | Number    | R          | Over-the-air current progress                |    X     |

`ota-status` shows the _overall status_ if your device is _up to date_ or an _update is available_.
`ota-state` and `ota-progress` shows more detailed information which you may want to follow, that's why they are declared as advanced channels.

**OTA Mappings**

Mappings for `ota-status`

- 0 : Up to date
- 1 : Update available

Mappings for `ota-state`

- 0 : Ready to check
- 1 : Check in progress
- 2 : Ready to download
- 3 : Download in progress
- 4 : Update in progress
- 5 : Update failed
- 6 : Ready to update
- 7 : Check failed
- 8 : Download failed
- 9 : Update complete
- 10 : Battery check failed

#### Links and Candidates

Devices can be connected directly e.g. sensors or controllers with lights, plugs, blinds or speakers.
It's detected during runtime if a device is capable to support links _and_ if devices are available in your system to support this connection.
The channels are declared advanced and can be used for setup procedure.

| Channel               | Type                  | Read/Write | Description                                      | Advanced |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------|
| `links`               | String                | RW         | Linked controllers and sensors                   |    X     |
| `link-candidates`     | String                | RW         | Candidates which can be linked                   |    X     |

<img align="right" width="300" src="doc/link-candidates.png">

Several devices can be linked together like

- [Light Controller](#light-controller) and [Motion Sensors](#motion-sensor) to [Plugs](#power-plugs) and [Lights](#lights)
- [Blind Controller](#blind-controller) to [Blinds](#blinds)
- [Sound Controller](#sound-controller) to [Speakers](#speaker)

Established links are shown in channel `links`.
The linked devices can be clicked in the UI and the link will be removed.

Possible candidates to be linked are shown in channel `link-candidates`.
If a candidate is clicked in the UI the link will be established.

Candidates and links marked with `(!)` are not present in openHAB environment so no handler is created yet.
In this case it's possible not all links are shown in the UI, but the present ones shall work.

#### Other Channels

| Channel               | Type              | Read/Write | Description                                  |
|-----------------------|-------------------|------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `startup`             | Number            | RW         | Startup behavior after power cutoff          |
| `custom-name`         | String            | RW         | Name given from IKEA home smart app          |

`startup` defines how the device shall behave after a power cutoff.
If there's a dedicated hardwired light switch which cuts power towards the bulb it makes sense to switch them on every time the switch is pressed.
But it's also possible to recover the last state.

Mappings for `startup`

- 0 : Previous
- 1 : On
- 2 : Off
- 3 : Switch

Option 3 is offered in IKEA Home smart app to control lights with using your normal light switch _slowly and smooth_.
With this the light shall stay online.
I wasn't able to reproduce this behavior.
Maybe somebody has more success.


`custom-name` is declared e.g. in your IKEA Home smart app.
This name is reflected in the discovery and if thing is created this name will be the thing label.
If `custom-name` is changed via openHAB API or a rule the label will not change.

### Unknown Devices

Filter your traces regarding 'DIRIGERA MODEL Unsupported Device'. 
The trace contains a JSON object at the end which is needed to implement a corresponding handler.

## Air Purifier

Air cleaning device with particle filter.

| Channel               | Type              | Read/Write | Description                                  |
|-----------------------|-------------------|------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `fan-mode`            | Number            | RW         | Fan on, off, speed or automatic behavior     |
| `fan-speed`           | Dimmer            | RW         | Manual regulation of fan speed               |
| `fan-runtime`         | Number:Time       | R          | Fan runtime in minutes                       |
| `filter-elapsed`      | Number:Time       | R          | Filter elapsed time in minutes               |
| `filter-remain`       | Number:Time       | R          | Time to filter replacement in minutes        |
| `filter-lifetime`     | Number:Time       | R          | Filter lifetime in minutes                   |
| `filter-alarm`        | Switch            | R          | Filter alarm signal                          |
| `particulate-matter`  | Number:Density    | R          | Category 2.5 particulate matter              |
| `disable-status-light`| Switch            | RW         | Disable status light on plug                 |
| `child-lock`          | Switch            | RW         | Child lock for button on plug                |

There are several `Number:Time` which are delivered in minutes as default.
Note you can change the unit when connecting an item e.g. to `d` (days) for readability.
So you can check in a rule if your remaining filter time is going below 7 days instead of calculating minutes.

#### Blind Channel Mappings

Mappings for `blind-state`

- 0 : Stopped
- 1 : Up
- 2 : Down

## Lights

Light devices in several variants.
Can be light bulbs, LED stripes, remote driver and more.
Configuration contains

| Name              | Type    | Description                                                         | Default | Required |
|-------------------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|----------|
| `id`              | text    | Unique id of this device / scene                                    | N/A     | yes      |
| `fadeTime`        | integer | Required time for fade sequnce to color or brightness               | 750     | yes      |
| `fadeSequence`    | integer | Define sequence if several light parameters are changed at once     | 0       | yes      |

`fadeTime` adjust fading time according to your device.
Current behavior shows commands are acknowledged while device is fading  but not executed correctly.
So they need to be executed one after another. 
Maybe an update of the DIRIGERA gateway will change the current behavior and you can reduce them afterwards.

`fadeSequence` is only for [Color Lights](#color-lights). 
Through `hsb` channel it's possible to adapt color brightness at once.
Again due to fading times they need to be executed in a sequence.
You can choose between options

- 0: First brightness, then color
- 1: First color, then brightness

### Lights ON OFF Behavior

When light is ON each command will change the settings accordingly immediately.
During power OFF the lights will preserve some values until next power ON.

| Channel               | Type          | Behavior                                                                  |

Channel `mute` should be writable but this isnn't the case now.
See [Known Limitations](#speaker-limitations). 

## Repeater

Repeater to strengthen signal.
Sadly there's no further information like _signal strength_ available so only [OTA channels](#ota-channels) and [custom name](#other-channels) is available. 
 
## Scenes

Scene from IKEA home smart app which can be triggered.
 
| Channel               | Type                  | Read/Write | Description                                  |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------|----------------------------------------------|

| `last-trigger`        | DateTime              | R          | Date and time when last trigger occurred     |

Scenes are defined in IKEA Home smart app and can be performed via `trigger` channel.
Two commands are defined:

- 0 : Trigger
- 1 : Undo

If command 0 (Trigger) is sent scene will be executed.
There's a 30 seconds time slot to send command 1 (Undo). 
The countdown is updating `trigger` channel state which can be evaluated if an undo operation is still possible.
State will switch to `Undef` after countdown.

## Known Limitations

### Gateway Limitations

Gateway channel `location` is reflecting the state correctly but isn't writable.
The Model says it `canReceive` command `coordinates` but in fact sending responds `http status 400`.
Channel will stay in this binding hoping a DIRIGERA software update will resolve this issue.

### Speaker Limitations

Speaker channel `mute` is reflecting the state correctly but isn't writable.
The Model says it `canReceive` command `isMuted` but in fact sending responds `http status 400`.
If mute is performed on Sonos App the channel is updating correctly, but sending the command fails!
Channel will stay in this binding hoping a DIRIGERA software update will resolve this issue.

## Development and Testing

Debugging is essential for such a binding which supports many available products and needs to support future products.
General debug messages will overflow traces and it's hard to find relevant information.
To deal with these challenges commands for [openHAB console](https://www.openhab.org/docs/administration/console.html) are provided.

```
Usage: openhab:dirigera token - Get token from DIRIGERA hub
Usage: openhab:dirigera json [<deviceId> | all] - Print JSON data
Usage: openhab:dirigera debug [<deviceId> | all] [true | false]  - Enable / disable detailed debugging for specific / all devices
```

### `token`

Prints the access token to communicate with DIRIGERA gateway as console output.

```
console> openhab:dirigera token
DIRIGERA Hub token: abcdef12345.......
```

With token available you can test your devices e.g. via curl commands.

```java
curl -X PATCH https://$YOUR_IP:8443/v1/devices/$DEVICE -H 'Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '[{"attributes":{"colorHue":280,"colorSaturation":1}}]' --insecure
```

Replace content in curl command with following variables:

- $YOUR_IP - IP address of DIRIGERA gateway
- $DEVICE - bulb id you want to control, take it from configuration
- $TOKEN - shortly stop / start DIRIGERA bridge and search for obtained token

### `json`

Get capabilities and current status for one `deviceId` or all devices.
Output is shown on console as JSON String.

```
console> openhab:dirigera json 3c8b0049-eb5c-4ea1-9da3-cdedc50366ef_1
{"deviceType":"light","isReachable":true,"capabilities":{"canReceive":["customName","isOn","lightLevel","colorTemperature", ...}
```

### `debug`

Enables or disables detailed logging for one `deviceId` or all devices.
Answer is `Done` if command is successfully executed.
If you operate with the device you can see requests and responses in openHAB Log Viewer.
If device cannot be found answer is `Device Id xyz not found `.
 
```
console> openhab:dirigera debug all true
Done
```

### Rule Examples

#### Shortcut Controller Rules

Catch triggers from shortcut controller and trigger a scene.

```java
rule "Shortcut Button 1 Triggers"
when
    Channel 'dirigera:double-shortcut:myhome:my-shortcut-controller:button1' triggered
then
    logInfo("DIRIGERA","Button 1 {}",receivedEvent)
    myhome-light-scene.sendCommand(0)
end
```

#### Motion Sensor Rules

Change the active duration time 

```java
rule "Sensor configuration"
when
    System started
then
    logInfo("DIRIGERA","Configuring IKEA sensors")
    // active duration = 180 seconds
    Bedroom_Motion_Active_Duration.sendCommand(180)
    // active duration = 3 minutes aka 180 seconds
    Bedroom_Motion_Active_Duration.sendCommand("3 min")
end
```
