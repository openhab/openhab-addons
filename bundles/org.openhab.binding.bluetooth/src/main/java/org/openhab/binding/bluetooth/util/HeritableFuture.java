/**
 * The {@code HeritableFuture} class extends {@link CompletableFuture} and adds the ability
 * to cancel upstream CompletableFuture tasks. Normally when a CompletableFuture
 * is cancelled only dependent futures cancel. This class will also cancel the parent
 * HeritableFuture instances as well. All of the {@code CompletionStage} methods will
 * return HeritableFuture children and thus by only maintaining a reference to the final future
 * in the task chain it would be possible to cancel the entire chain by calling {@code cancel}.
 * <p>
 * Due to child futures now having a link to their parent futures, it is no longer possible
 * for HeritableFuture to be garbage collected as upstream futures complete. It is highly
 * advisable to only use a HeritableFuture for defining finite (preferably small) task trees. Do not use
 * HeritableFuture in situations where you would endlessly append new tasks otherwise you will eventually
 * cause an OutOfMemoryError.
