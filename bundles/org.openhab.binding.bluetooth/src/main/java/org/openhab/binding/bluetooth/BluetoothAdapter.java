/**
 * The {@link BluetoothAdapter} class defines the standard adapter API that must be implemented by bridge handlers,
 * which are then required to be registered as a BluetoothAdapter OSGi service.
 * <p>
 * <b>Scanning</b>
 * The API assumes that the adapter is "always" scanning to enable beacons to be received.
 * The bridge must decide to enable and disable scanning as it needs. This design choice avoids interaction between
 * higher layers where a binding may want to enable scanning while another needs to disable scanning for a specific
 * function (e.g. to connect to a device). The bridge should disable scanning only for the period that is needed.
