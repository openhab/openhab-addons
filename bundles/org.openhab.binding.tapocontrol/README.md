## Prerequisites

Before using Smart Plugs with openHAB the devices must be connected to the Wi-Fi network.
This can be done using the Tapo provided mobile app.
You need to setup a bridge (Cloud-Login) to commiunicate with your devices.

**Note:** If the Tapo device is to be isolated from the internet e.g. on an IoT LAN, the P110 will not expose its energy and power data until it has successfully synchronised it's clock with an NTP server - at time of writing, this was `pool.ntp.org`.
To satisfy this requirement while keeping the device isolated, your router should be configured to either permit `udp/123` out to the internet or a NAT rule created to redirect all internet bound NTP traffic to a local NTP server.

## Discovery

For Wi-Fi-Devices, discovery is done by connecting to the Tapo-Cloud-Service or use local udp-discovery.
If enabled, all devices stored in your cloud account will be detected even if they are not in your local network.
From cloud you can get more informations such as "Device-Alias" as from udp-discovery.
But you need to know the IP-Adress of your device. This must be set manually in the thing configuration.

UDP-Discovery can find only devices which are online in your local network and get less informations as from cloud.
But therefore it set's device-ip and protocol automaticly.
If you have problems with udp-discovery, try to set the advanced setting 'broadcastAddress' to your local subnet ('e.g. 192.168.0.255').
Default is '255.255.255.255'

You can combine both discovery methods to get any informations from local devices.
If you enable setting 'onlyLocalOnlineDevices' results will only generated for local online devices but with the combined data of cloud discovery.
RF-Devices will be discovered by the hub they are connected to.
You can discover them manually or use ´backgroundDiscovery´

RF-Devices will be discovered by the hub they are connected to. You can discover them manually or use ´backgroundDiscovery´

## Bridge Configuration

The bridge needs to be configured with by `username` and `password` (Tapo-Cloud login) .
This is used for device discovery and to create a handshake (cookie) to act with your devices over the local network.

The thing has the following configuration parameters:

| Parameter              | Description                                                                                                    |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| username               | Username (eMail) of your Tapo-Cloud                                                                            |

| cloudDiscovery         | Use Cloud Discovery-Service to get all in Tapo-App registered devices. Includes DeviceName. IP-Address and Encryption has to set manually             |
| udpDiscovery           | Use UDP Discovery-Service to discover online devices in the local network. Includes Encryption and IP-Address. Results will be merged with cloud discovery      |
| onlyLocalOnlineDevices | [advanced] Uses Cloud and UPD-Discovery to get more informations but will only discover online devices via UDP |
| broadcastAddress       | [advanced] Set broadcast address to your local subnet  if you have problems with default address               |
| discoveryInterval      | [advanced] Interval in minutes when a background device scan should be executed. Default is 60                 |


## Thing Configuration

WiFi-based things needs to be configured with `ipAddress`.
RF-based things need a SmartHub(WiFi-Device) to operate.

The things has the following configuration parameters:

| pollingInterval    | [optional] Refresh interval in seconds. The default is 30 seconds     | Any Wi-Fi-Device            |
| httpPort           | [optional] HTTP-Communication Port. Default is 80                     | Any Wi-Fi-Device            |

| backgroundDiscovery| [optional] RF-Devices will be discovered after every polling request  | SmartHub                    |


## Channels

All devices support some of the following channels:

## Channel Refresh

When the thing receives a `RefreshType` command the thing will send a new refreshRequest over http.
To minimize network traffic the default refresh-rate is set to 30 seconds. This can be reduced down to 10 seconds in advanced settings of the device. If any command was sent to a channel, it will do an immediately refresh of the whole device.
