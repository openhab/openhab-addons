# LG TV Serial Binding

This binding controls LG TVs, monitors and projectors that have an RS-232C control port.

See below for a list of supported channels.

## Supported Things

Supports one TV, monitor or projector per thing, also corresponding to a unique serial port.
The protocol supports daisy-chaining of serial devices.

The LG serial command set appears to be similar on many models ([1], [5]), but not all commands will work on all models.

The control port on most TVs is a male DE-9 connector that requires a "Null modem" cable to connect to a serial port or USB to serial adapter.

Some TVs have a 3.5 mm phone jack for the control port instead of a DE-9 connector, and may thus require the use of an adapter cable.

The 3.5 mm phone jack may work with a generic 3.5 mm TRS phone plug to DE-9 cable or possibly LG part # EAD62707901 or EAD62707902 (3.5 mm TRRS to DE-9).

The control port may be marked "Service Only".

Tested and developed with:

- LG 55UF772V with a generic 3.5 mm TRS phone plug to DE-9 cable
- LG 47LK520 with a [serial hat](https://www.pishop.ca/product/serial-hat-rs232/) on a Raspberry Pi

## Discovery

No discovery supported; manual configuration is required.

## Thing Configuration

The thing has the following configuration parameters:

| Parameter Label        | Parameter ID         | Description                                                                     | Accepted values  |
|------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| Serial Port            | port                 | Serial port to use for connecting to TV/monitor/projector.                      | Serial port name |
| Set ID                 | setId                | Set ID configured in the TV. If 0, will send the commands to every chained TV.  | 0-99; default 1  |

It is necessary to specify the serial port used for communication.
On Linux systems, this will usually be either `/dev/ttyS0`, `/dev/ttyUSB0` or `/dev/ttyACM0` (or a higher  number than `0` if multiple devices are present).
On Windows it will be `COM1`, `COM2`, etc.

The Set ID can also be specified when using daisy-chaining.
This allows you to have a Thing that will handle a particular device (with Set ID other than 0), and another to send commands to all devices (with Set  equals 0).
However, the item values for the Thing with Set ID 0 will never display the right values as it receives responses from many devices.

## Channels

The following channels are common to most TVs, taken from [4].

| Channel ID      | Command | Item Type | Description                                      |
|-----------------|---------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| aspect-ratio    | k c     | String    | Adjust screen format, at least 4:3, 16:9 formats |
| power           | k a     | Switch    | Turns the device on or off                       |
| volume          | k f     | Dimmer    | Sets the volume, values are from 0 to 100        |
| volume-mute     | k e     | Switch    | Set mute on or off                               |

As for others, please refer to the documentation of your device in the section named "Controlling the multiple product", "External control" or any section that refers to RS-232.
If your device documentation doesn't give such information, you can look at the "LG protocol references" below and use the "Generic LG TV" thing which should contain all the different possible channels/commands.

Note: Devices might not respond or return an error to some command when the device is powered off which can put items in an incorrect state until the device is turned on.
For instance, getting the volume status when the device is off makes no sense.
