# binding

binding.nuki.name = Nuki Binding
binding.nuki.description = The Nuki Binding allows simple and fast integration of Nuki Smart Locks into openHAB. This binding needs the Nuki Smart Lock(s) to be paired via Bluetooth with a Nuki Bridge to function correctly.

# thing types

thing-type.nuki.bridge.label = Nuki Bridge
thing-type.nuki.bridge.description = This bridge represents a Nuki Bridge on your local network. Nuki Smart Locks have to be paired via Bluetooth with it.
thing-type.nuki.opener.label = Nuki Opener
thing-type.nuki.opener.description = Nuki Opener which is paired via Bluetooth to a Nuki Bridge.
thing-type.nuki.smartlock.label = Nuki Smart Lock
thing-type.nuki.smartlock.description = Nuki Smart Lock which is paired via Bluetooth to a Nuki Bridge.

# thing types config

thing-type.config.nuki.bridge.apiToken.label = API Token
thing-type.config.nuki.bridge.apiToken.description = The API Token which you configured during Initial Bridge setup (https://nuki.io/en/support/bridge/bridge-setup/initial-bridge-setup/).
thing-type.config.nuki.bridge.ip.label = IP Address
thing-type.config.nuki.bridge.ip.description = The IP address of the Nuki Bridge. Look it up on your router. It is recommended to set a static IP address lease for the Nuki Bridge (and for your openHAB server too) on your router.
thing-type.config.nuki.bridge.manageCallbacks.label = Manage Nuki Bridge Callbacks
thing-type.config.nuki.bridge.manageCallbacks.description = Let the Nuki Binding manage the callback on the Nuki Bridge. Nuki bridge uses HTTP callback to notify openHAB about changes in device properties (e.g. when doors are opened, unlocked, doorbell rings, battery level changes etc.). If callback is not registered, binding will not work properly and channels will not be updated. If this is enabled, binding will automatically register and unregister callback as necessary. If this is disabled, user must register callback manually. It is recommended that this is turned on.
thing-type.config.nuki.bridge.port.label = Port
thing-type.config.nuki.bridge.port.description = The Port which you configured during Initial Bridge setup (https://nuki.io/en/support/bridge/bridge-setup/initial-bridge-setup/).
thing-type.config.nuki.bridge.secureToken.label = Secure Token
thing-type.config.nuki.bridge.secureToken.description = Use hashed token when communicating with bridge. This increases security and prevents sniffing of access token and replay attacks, since communication with bridge is not encrypted. For this feature to work, both device running openHAB and Nuki Bridge must have synchronized time. When disabled, token is sent in plain text with each bridge request. It is recommended that this is turned on unless there are problems with synchronizing time between openHAB and Nuki Bridge.
thing-type.config.nuki.opener.nukiId.label = Nuki ID
thing-type.config.nuki.opener.nukiId.description = The decimal string that identifies the Nuki Opener.
thing-type.config.nuki.smartlock.deviceType.label = Device Type
thing-type.config.nuki.smartlock.deviceType.description = Numeric device type as specified by bridge HTTP API - 0 = Nuki Smart Lock 1.0/2.0, 3 = Nuki Smart Door, 4 = Nuki Smart Lock 3.0 (Pro). Sent with each API request. Its purpose is not documented, seems to only be used for distinguishing between opener and smartlock actions. There does not seem to be any (documented or observable) differences between different smart lock device types.
thing-type.config.nuki.smartlock.nukiId.label = Nuki ID
thing-type.config.nuki.smartlock.nukiId.description = The decimal string that identifies the Nuki Smart Lock.
thing-type.config.nuki.smartlock.unlatch.label = Unlatch
thing-type.config.nuki.smartlock.unlatch.description = If switched to On (or set to true) the Nuki Smart Lock will unlock the door but then also automatically pull the latch of the door lock. Usually, if the door hinges are correctly adjusted, the door will then swing open.
