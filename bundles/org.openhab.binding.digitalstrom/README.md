# digitalSTROM Binding

  This binding integrates the [digitalSTROM-System](https://www.digitalstrom.de/).
The integration happens through the digitalSTROM-Server, which acts as a gateway to connect the digitalSTROM-Devices.
The digitalSTROM-Server communicates through the digitalSTROM-Meters with the digitalSTROM-Devices, which are directly connected to the power-line.

**Note:** All was tested with digitalSTROM-Server firmware version 1.9.3 to 1.10.3.

## Supported Things

### digitalSTROM-Server

The digitalSTROM-Server is required for accessing any other digitalSTROM-Devices. It acts like a _"bridge"_.

### digitalSTROM-Devices

At this point almost all available **GE**, **SW**, **GR** and **BL** digitalSTROM-Devices with a set output-mode, unequal _disabled_, are supported by this binding.
Furthermore sensor devices like the **dS-iSens200** and **SW-devices** with binary-inputs are supported.
Last but not least the **circuit** (dS-Meter) is supported, too. They will provide the power consumption and electric meter as channels.

For that there are identically named thing types. Only the _GR_ type has a channel (shade), which cannot be changed.
The other types add their channels dynamically affected by the set color-group and output-mode.
They also automatically change or add the channels, if the color-group or output-mode has changed through the dSS-web-configuration or the configured sensor priorities of the thing has changed.

- The following table shows all tested digitalSTROM-Devices with their output-modes.

| HW-Type | Output-Mode    | Tested color group  |
|-----------------|------------------------|--------------|
| GE-KL200 | switched | yellow  |
| GE-KM200 | switched, dimmed | yellow |
| GE-TKM210 | switched, dimmed | yellow |
| GE-SDM200 | switched, dimmed | yellow |
| GE-UMV200 | 1-10V dimmed | yellow |
| GR-KL200 | standard output-mode | grey |
| GR-KL210 | standard output-mode| grey |
| GR-KL220 | standard output-mode | grey |
| SW-KL200 | switch, powersave, wipe | black, yellow |
| SW-UMR200 | single switched, combined switch, combined 2 stage switch, combined 3 stage switch | yellow , black |
| SW-ZWS200 | switch, powersave, wipe | black, yellow |
| BL-KM200 | switch, pwm | blue |

- Binary-inputs were tested with SW-UMR200.
- Sensor channels were tested with dS-iSens200 and power sensor with all other supported devices, which are listed in the table above.

### digitalSTROM-Scenes

Furthermore the digitalSTROM-Scene concept is part of the digitalSTROM-Binding.
These scenes are implemented as virtual things.
The different scene thing types are listed in the following table.

| Thing-Type-ID | Label    | Description |
|-----------------|------------------------|--------------|
| appScene  | Apartment-Scene | Represents a digitalSTROM Apartment-Scene.  |
| zoneScene  | Zone-Scene | Represents a digitalSTROM Zone-Scene.  |
| groupScene  | Group-Scene | Represents a digitalSTROM Group-Scene.  |
| namedScene  | Named-Scene | Represents a digitalSTROM Scene, which has a user-defined name.  |

### digitalSTROM-Zone-Temperature-Control

Last but not least, the digitalSTROM-Zone-Temperature-Control is also supported, if a zone-temerature-control is configured, as thing-type **zone_temperature_control**.
The difference between the digitalSTROM-heating-control-app is, that there are no operation-modes, like _comfort_ or _eco_.
You can directly set the target temperature, in case _pid-control_ is configured, otherwise you can set the value in percent of heating valves at the zone.
The needed channels will be added automatically, as it is also the case for the devices.

## Discovery

The digitalSTROM-Server is discovered by mDNS or _dss.local._ at the local network.
Once the server is added as a thing, you have to set a user name and password or insert a valid application-token to authenticate with the server.
If the binding is authorized, it automatically reads all supported devices, the dS-Meters and temperature controlled configured zones, that are set up on the digitalSTROM-System, and puts them into the _inbox_.

digitalSTROM-Scenes can be discovered, too.
The background scene-discovery is deactivated by default to not flood the inbox.
Otherwise it will discover so many scenes, that it can be difficult to find the searched devices.

Discoverable scenes are all user named scenes, group scenes that are reachable by local push-buttons, zone scenes and apartment scenes.
The discovery also will discover all called scenes, if they aren't automatically discovered yet.
Temperature control scenes, like _eco_ will be ignored, so they cannot be discovered.

If you only want to discover one of the thing types, you can start a discovery scan on the thing type you want to have discovered.
You can use the command line command, e.g.: ``openhab:discovery start digitalstrom:namedScene`` to start the scan.
Which thing types this binding supports, please have a look at **Supported Things**.

## Thing Configuration and Properties

### digitalSTROM-Server

The digitalSTROM-Server thing has the following configuration parameter groups: _Connection configuration_, _Server information_ and _General configurations_.

#### Connection configuration

If the digitalSTROM-Server isn’t found automatically, e.g. because the server isn’t placed at the local network or the mDNS-service is deactivated, you have to insert the network address or URL and the authentication data manually through the graphical user interface or type it into the \*.thing with textual configuration.
If you use your user name and password for authentication and there is already a token for this application, it will be automatically retrieved from the digitalSTROM-Server, otherwise a new application-token will be generated.

|-------|---------|------------------------------------|----------------- |
| scene | Switch | The scene channel allows to call or undo a scene from digitalSTROM. | all scene-types |

**Notes:**

_Generally:_

- The digitalSTROM-Server only informs the binding about scene-commands. So if you set the output value of devices e.g. through  the dSS-App, the binding will not be informed about the changes and you have to send a "refresh-command" to update the channel.
- If you press a physical switch at your digitalSTROM-installation and the called scene-value is not red out yet, it can take a bit time to read it out and change the state of the channel.
  It the scene-value is red out, the state will change immediately.
  See also _General-Informations/digitalSTROM-Scenes_.

_Channels with accepted command type increase and decrease:_

- digitalSTROM will only evaluate increase and decrease commands, if a scene was called before which turn the device on.

_Blinds:_

- Increase, decrease and up, down commands of the shade channel changes the angle in digitalSTROM, too. If you want to set only the position, you have to set the value directly.
- To protect the slats digitalSTROM changes the position by setting the angle, too, if the position is very high or low. So if you want to see the correct position, you have to send a refresh or stop command, if the blind is ready.

The device scene configuration will be saved persistently to the thing properties, if the thing is not textual configured (because textual configured things will not be persisted), to update the device state faster.
For that each scene configuration of each device has to be read out first, because of the digitalSTROM-rule 9 that requires a waiting period of one minute, that take some time so that at the first start a scene call can be take some time to read it out and update the device state.
To read it out faster only the discovered or called scenes will be read out.

**Note:**
Because the digitalSTROM-Server can't inform the binding about save scene events at this time, the persistently saved scene configurations can't be updated.
The current troubleshooting to read out the new scene configuration after a save scene action at the digitalSTROM-Server is the following:

1. delete the thing to delete the persistently saved scene configuration
1. restart the server to delete the temporary saved scene configuration
1. add the thing again to read out the scene configuration again.

### Initial state of digitalSTROM-Scenes and devices

To get the device and scene state after a server start or restart, the binding uses the last called group scenes of digitalSTROM.
Because of that there are two things to be observed:

1. If a device status has changed through a device scene or a directly set output value, the status is maybe not correct.
1. If the last called group scene was not read out yet, it can takes some time until the status will be updated.

### Textual configuration notice

If you configure your system with textual configuration files, like _\*.thing_, there is one things you have to  consider.

- The feature of the persisting of scene-configurations, to get the scene-configurations after a restart faster (see _digitalSTROM-Scenes_ above), will not support  textural configured things, because the properties cannot be persist in this case.

### Rule specific notice

If you want to create a rule, which uses things of the digitalSTROM-Binding, there are also two things you have to consider.

1. If the rule contains several digitalSTROM-Devices, which can be summarized in a digitalSTROM-Scene, e.g. some lights in a zone, please use an equivalent supported scene. That will significantly reduce the communication to the digitalSTROM-Server, increases performance and does not bypass the digitalSTROM state-machine.
1. If you implement your own temperature control algorithm for a zone/room, e.g. because you want to use other temperature sensors, and call more than one digitalSTROM-BL-KM200, please use the _zone_temperature_control_ for valve value control. The _zone_temperature_control_ for valve value control will call all digitalSTROM-BL-KM200 with one command and increases the performance. To get the needed channel at the _zone_temperature_control_ you have to choose a control mode unequal to _pid-controlled_ for the affected zone at the digitalSTROM-heating-control-app.
