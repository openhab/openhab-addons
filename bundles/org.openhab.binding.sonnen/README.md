# Sonnen Binding

The binding for sonnen communicates with a sonnen battery.
More information about the sonnen battery can be found [here](https://sonnen.de/).
The binding supports the old deprecated V1 from sonnen as well as V2 which requires an authentication token.
More information about the V2 API can be found at `http://LOCAL-SONNENBATTERY-SYSTEM-IP/api/doc.html`

## Supported Things

| Thing Type    | Description                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| sonnenbattery | Monitoring of a sonnen battery |

## Thing Configuration

Only the parameter `hostIP` is required; this is the IP address of the sonnen battery in your local network.
If you want to use the V2 API, which supports more channels, you need to provide the `authToken`.

## Channels

The following channels are yet supported:

| Channel                        | Type          | Access | Description                                                                             |

| flowConsumptionBatteryState    | Switch        | read   | Indicates if there is a current flow from Battery towards Consumption                   |
| flowConsumptionGridState       | Switch        | read   | Indicates if there is a current flow from Grid towards Consumption                      |
| flowConsumptionProductionState | Switch        | read   | Indicates if there is a current flow from Solar Production towards Consumption          |
| flowGridBatteryState           | Switch        | read   | Indicates if there is a current flow from Grid towards Battery                          |
| flowProductionBatteryState     | Switch        | read   | Indicates if there is a current flow from Production towards Battery                    |
| energyImportedStateProduction  | Number:Energy | read   | Indicates the imported kWh Production                                                   |
| energyExportedStateProduction  | Number:Energy | read   | Indicates the exported kWh Production                                                   |
| energyImportedStateConsumption | Number:Energy | read   | Indicates the imported kWh Consumption                                                  |
