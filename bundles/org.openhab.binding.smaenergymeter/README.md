# SMA Energy Meter Binding

This Binding is used to display the measured values of a SMA Energy Meter device.
It shows purchased and grid feed-in power and energy.

## Supported Things

This Binding supports SMA Energy Meter devices.

## Discovery

The Energy Meter is discovered by receiving data on the default multicast IP address.

## Binding Configuration

No binding configuration required.

## Thing Configuration

Usually no manual configuration is required, as the multicast IP address and the port remain on their factory set values.
Optionally, a refresh interval (in seconds) can be defined.

|------------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|----------|-----------------|
| `serialNumber`   | Serial number   | Serial number of a meter.                                  | yes      |                 |
| `mcastGroup`     | Multicast Group | Multicast group used by meter.                             | yes      | 239.12.255.254  |
| `port`           | Port            | Port number used by meter.                                 | no       | 9522            |
| `pollingPeriod`  | Polling Period  | Polling period used to publish meter reading (in seconds). | no       | 30              |
