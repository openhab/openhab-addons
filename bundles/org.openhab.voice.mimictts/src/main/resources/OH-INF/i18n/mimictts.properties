voice.config.mimictts.phonemeVolatility.label = Phoneme Volatility
voice.config.mimictts.phonemeVolatility.description = The amount of noise used to generate phoneme durations (0-1). Allows for variable speaking cadance, with a value closer to 1 being more variable. Multi-speaker models tend to sound better with a lower amount of phoneme variability than single speaker models.
