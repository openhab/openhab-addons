# HomeWizard Binding

The HomeWizard binding provides access to several HomeWizard devices by using the local API of those devices.

## Installation

There are two important points of attention:

1. For API v1, the local API of each device must be enabled and a fixed address must be configured for the devices.
2. For API v2, a bearer token needs to be obtained from the device. See https://api-documentation.homewizard.com/ for instructions how to obtain a token.

### Local API v1

The local API of a device can be enabled from the HomeWizard app.
Go to Settings in the app, then Meters and select the device you want to enable.
On this page enable the local API.

### Local API v2

This version is still in beta. Currently hwe-p1 and hwe-bat are supported. 

### Fixed Address

The devices support mDNS discovery but the binding does not support that yet.
As a result the devices should be reachable through a hostname or a fixed IP address.
Since the devices themselves have no option to set a fixed IP address you will need a different solution, for instance having your router hand out an IP address based upon the MAC address of the devices.

## Supported Things

The binding offers Things, providing access to all the supported HomeWizard devices.

| Thing         | Device              | Description                                                                                         |
|---------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| hwe-p1        | P1 Meter            | Reads total and current energy usage and total gas usage (v1 and v2).                               |

| hwe-bat       | Plug-In Battery     | Reads total and current energy usage and the current charge (v2).                                   |
| p1_wifi_meter | Wi-Fi P1 Meter      | [Deprecated] Reads total and current energy usage and total gas usage.                              |

## Discovery

Auto discovery is not available for this binding.

## Thing Configuration

All devices can be configured through the web interface.

| Parameter    | Required | Default | Description                                                                                       |
|--------------|----------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ipAddress    | *        |         | This specifies the IP address (or host name) where the meter can be found.                        |
| refreshDelay |          | 5       | This specifies the interval in seconds used by the binding to read updated values from the meter. |
| apiVersion   | *        | v1      | The API version to be used. v2 is still in beta but is already supported in this binding.         |
| bearerToken  |          |         | The bearer token to be used when using API v2.                                                    |

Note that update rate of the P1 Meter itself depends on the frequency of the telegrams it receives from the Smart Meter.
For DSMR5 meters this is generally once per second, for older versions the frequency is much lower.
