/**
 * Shade coordinate system (a.k.a. position kind), as returned by the HD PowerView hub.

 * @param NONE a coordinate system that does not refer to any type of physical rail.
 * @param PRIMARY_POSITION primary rail, whose coordinate value 0 means shade is closed.
 * @param SECONDARY_POSITION secondary rail, whose coordinate value 0 means shade is open.
 * @param VANE_TILT_POSITION vane/tilt operator, whose coordinate system is for vanes.
 * @param ERROR_UNKNOWN unsupported coordinate system.

 * @author Andrew Fiddian-Green - Rewritten as a new enum called
 *         CoordinateSystem to support secondary rail positions and be more

     * Specifies the coordinate system used for the position of the shade. Top-down
     * shades are in the same coordinate space as bottom-up shades. Shade position
     * values for top-down shades would be reversed for bottom-up shades. For
     * example, since 65535 is the open value for a bottom-up shade, it is the
     * closed value for a top-down shade. The top-down/bottom-up shade is different
     * in that instead of the top and bottom rail operating in one coordinate space
     * like the top-down and the bottom-up, it operates in two where the top
     * (middle) rail closed value is 0 and the bottom (primary) rail closed position
     * is also 0 and fully open for both is 65535
     *
     * The position element can take on multiple states depending on the family of
     * shade under control.

     * ALTERNATE: Shade and vane fully down: (top-down: closed, bottom-up: open)
     *      posKind: 3 {VANE_COORDS}
