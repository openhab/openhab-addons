# GROHE ONDUS Binding

The GROHE ONDUS Binding provides access to data collected by a GROHE ONDUS appliance, such as an [GROHE Sense Guard](https://www.grohe.de/de_de/smarthome/grohe-sense-guard/).
The binding uses the REST API interface (the same as used by the Android App) to retrieve the collected data.

## Supported Things

This binding should support all appliances from GROHE, however, only the GROHE Sense and Sense Guard is tested with it.

| Thing type               | Name                     |
|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| account                  | GROHE ONDUS Account      |
| senseguard               | GROHE SENSE Guard device |
| sense                    | GROHE SENSE device       |

## Discovery

The binding requires you to create at least one Account thing as a bridge manually.
The discovery process will look through all locations and rooms of your configured GROHE account and adds each found appliance as a new thing automatically to the inbox.

## Binding Configuration

This binding does not require any configuration outside of things.

## Thing Configuration

There is only one thing and one bridge that needs to be configured together to get this binding to work, see the full example section for a self-explaining example.

### Account Bridge

The `groheondus:account` bridge is used to configure the API interface for a specific account, which is used to access the collected and saved data of your GROHE account.
Use the same credentials as in the mobile app.

### Appliance

The `groheondus:sense` and `groheondus:senseguard` things are used to retrieve information of a specific appliance from GROHE.
This appliance needs to be connected with your GROHE ONDUS account as configured in the corresponding Account Bridge.
The appliance needs to be configured with the unique appliance ID (with the `applianceId` configuration) as well as the `roomId` and the `locationId`.
Once the account bridge is configured, the appliances in your account will be discovered as Appliance things.
`pollingInterval` has a minimum value of 900 seconds to avoid service rate limiting.

| Configuration            | Default value            | Description                                           |
|--------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| applianceId              | ''                       | Unique ID of the appliance in the GROHE ONDUS account |
| roomId                   | ''                       | ID of the room the appliance is in                    |
| locationId               | ''                       | ID of the location (building) the appliance is in     |
| pollingInterval          | Retrieved from API,      | Interval in seconds to get new data from the API      |
|                          | usually 900              | The `sense` thing uses 900 by default.                |
