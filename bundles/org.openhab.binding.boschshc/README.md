## Limitations

No major limitation known.
Check list of [openhab issues with "boshshc"](https://github.com/openhab/openhab-addons/issues?q=is%3Aissue+boschshc+) 

## Discovery

Bridge discovery is supported via mDNS.
Things discovery is started after successful pairing.

Configuration via configuration files or UI supported too (see below).

## Bridge Configuration

You need to provide the IP address and the system password of your Bosch Smart Home Controller.
The IP address of the controller is visible in the Bosch Smart Home Mobile App (More -> System -> Smart Home Controller) or in your network router UI.
The system password is set by you during your initial registration steps in the _Bosch Smart Home App_.

A keystore file with a self-signed certificate is created automatically.
This certificate is used for pairing between the Bridge and the Bosch Smart Home Controller.

_Press and hold the Bosch Smart Home Controller Bridge button until the LED starts blinking after you save your settings for pairing_.

## Getting the device IDs

Bosch IDs for found devices are displayed in the openHAB log on bootup (`OPENHAB_FOLDER/userdata/logs/openhab.log`)

The log can also be called using the following command.

```bash
tail -f /var/log/openhab/openhab.log /var/log/openhab/events.log
```

Alternatively, the log can be viewed using the OpenHab Log Viewer (frontail) via <http://openhab:9001>.

Example:

```bash

2023-03-20 20:30:48.027 [INFO ] [g.discovery.internal.PersistentInbox] - Added new thing 'boschshc:twinguard:yourBridgeName:hdm_ZigBee_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX' to inbox.
2023-03-20 20:30:48.028 [INFO ] [g.discovery.internal.PersistentInbox] - Added new thing 'boschshc:smart-bulb:yourBridgeName:hdm_PhilipsHueBridge_HueLight_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX-XX_XXXXXXXXXXXX' to inbox.
```

## Thing Configuration

You define your Bosch devices by adding them either to a `.things` file in your `$OPENHAB_CONF/things` folder like this:

```java
Bridge boschshc:shc:1 [ ipAddress="192.168.x.y", password="XXXXXXXXXX" ] {
  Thing in-wall-switch bathroom "Bathroom" [ id="hdm:HomeMaticIP:3014F711A000XXXXXXXXXXXX" ]
  Thing in-wall-switch bedroom "Bedroom" [ id="hdm:HomeMaticIP:3014F711A000XXXXXXXXXXXX" ]
  Thing in-wall-switch kitchen "Kitchen" [ id="hdm:HomeMaticIP:3014F711A000XXXXXXXXXXXX" ]
  Thing in-wall-switch corridor "Corridor" [ id="hdm:HomeMaticIP:3014F711A000XXXXXXXXXXXX" ]
  Thing in-wall-switch livingroom "Living Room" [ id="hdm:HomeMaticIP:3014F711A000XXXXXXXXXXXX" ]

  Thing in-wall-switch coffeemachine "Coffee Machine" [ id="hdm:HomeMaticIP:3014F711A0000XXXXXXXXXXXX" ]

  Thing twinguard      tg-corridor    "Twinguard Smoke Detector" [ id="hdm:ZigBee:000d6f000XXXXXXX" ]
  Thing window-contact window-kitchen "Window Kitchen"           [ id="hdm:HomeMaticIP:3014F711A00000XXXXXXXXXX" ]
  Thing window-contact entrance       "Entrance door"            [ id="hdm:HomeMaticIP:3014F711A00000XXXXXXXXXX" ]

  Thing motion-detector  motion-corridor "Bewegungsmelder"      [ id="hdm:ZigBee:000d6f000XXXXXXX" ]
}
```

Or by adding them via UI: Settings -> Things -> "+" -> Bosch Smart Home Binding.

## Item Configuration

You define the items which should be linked to your Bosch devices via a `.items` file in your `$OPENHAB_CONF/items` folder like this:

```java
Switch Bosch_Bathroom    "Bath Room"    { channel="boschshc:in-wall-switch:1:bathroom:power-switch" }
Switch Bosch_Bedroom     "Bed Room"     { channel="boschshc:in-wall-switch:1:bedroom:power-switch" }
Switch Bosch_Kitchen     "Kitchen"      { channel="boschshc:in-wall-switch:1:kitchen:power-switch" }
Switch Bosch_Corridor    "Corridor"     { channel="boschshc:in-wall-switch:1:corridor:power-switch" }
Switch Bosch_Living_Room "Living Room"  { channel="boschshc:in-wall-switch:1:livingroom:power-switch" }

Switch Bosch_Lelit       "Lelit"        { channel="boschshc:in-wall-switch:1:coffeemachine:power-switch" }
```

Or by adding them via UI: Settings -> Items -> "+".
