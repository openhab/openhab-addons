/**
 * A state containing information about intrusion detection events.
 * <p>
 * Example data:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * {
 *   "@type": "surveillanceAlarmState",
 *   "incidents": [
 *     {
 *       "triggerName": "Motion Detector",
 *       "locationId": "hz_5",
 *       "location": "Living Room",
 *       "id": "hdm:ZigBee:000d6f0012f02342",
 *       "time": 1652615755336,
 *       "type": "INTRUSION"
 *     }
 *   ],
 *   "value": "ALARM_ON"
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> This state is not documented in the official Bosch API docs.
 * The type of the incidents seems to be very similar to <code>IncidentType</code> documented for
 * the system state. However, the type enum seems to be slightly different (<code>INTRUSION</code> instead of
 * <code>INTRUSION_DETECTED</code>).
 * For this reason incidents are not modeled in this state object for now.
