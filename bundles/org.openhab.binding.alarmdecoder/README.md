# Alarm Decoder Binding

The [Alarm Decoder](https://www.alarmdecoder.com) from Nu Tech Software Solutions is a hardware adapter that interfaces with Ademco/Honeywell and DSC alarm panels.
It acts essentially like a keypad, reading and writing messages on the serial bus that connects keypads with the main panel.

There are several versions of the adapter available:

- _AD2PI_ or _AD2PHAT_ - A board that plugs into a Raspberry Pi and offers network-based TCP connectivity
- _AD2SERIAL_ - Attaches to a host via a serial port
- _AD2USB_ - Attaches to a host via USB

This binding allows openHAB to access the state of wired or wireless contacts and motion detectors connected to supported alarm panels, as well as the state of attached keypads and the messages send to attached LRR devices.
Support is also available for sending keypad commands, including special/programmable keys supported by your panel.

## Supported Things

The binding supports the following thing types:

- `ipbridge` - Supports TCP connection to the AD.
- `serialbridge` - Supports serial/USB connection to the AD.
- `keypad` - Reports keypad status and optionally sends keypad messages.
- `zone` - Reports status from zone expanders and relay expanders, and also from built-in zones via emulation.
- `rfzone` - Reports status from RF zones.
- `vzone` - Sends commands to virtual zones.
- `lrr` - Reports messages sent from the panel to a Long Range Radio (LRR) or emulated LRR device.

## Discovery

Background discovery is currently supported for `zone` and `rfzone` things.
If the bridge `discovery` parameter is set to _true_, the first time a status message is seen from each zone or RF zone a corresponding thing will appear in the inbox.
Leaving the `discovery` parameter set to _false_ during normal operation is recommended, as it will slightly reduce resource consumption by the binding.

## Prerequisites

The process for wiring the Alarm Decoder into the alarm panel and configuring it is described in the Alarm Decoder Quick Start guide for your model.
Before working on the main panel, it is advisable to put the alarm system in test mode, and un-plug the phone connection to it for good measure.
Don't forget to plug it back in when you are finished!

Understanding exactly what expansion boards are connected to the main panel is crucial for a successful setup of the AlarmDecoder and also helpful in interpreting the messages from the alarmdecoder.
While many of the expansion devices don't have labels on the outside, inserting a flat screwdriver into the right slot and prying gently will usually uncover a circuit board with numbers on it that can be looked up via web search.

Although not mentioned in the Quick Start guide, configuring virtual relay boards is absolutely necessary on panels like the Honeywell Vista 20p and similar, or else all of the eight on-board zones will not be visible!

## Thing Configuration

Alarm Decoder things can be configured through openHAB's management UI, or manually via configuration files.
When first configuring the binding it is probably easiest to configure it via the management UI, even if you plan to use configuration files later.
If you enable the _discovery_ option on the bridge, as you fault zones (e.g. open doors and windows, trigger motion detectors, etc.) they should appear in the discovery inbox.

### ipbridge

The `ipbridge` thing supports a TCP/IP connection to an Alarm Decoder device such as _AD2PI_ or _AD2PHAT_.

- `hostname` (required) The hostname or IP address of the Alarm Decoder device
- `tcpPort` (default = 10000) TCP port number for the Alarm Decoder connection
- `discovery` (default = false) Enable automatic discovery of zones and RF zones
- `reconnect` (1-60, default = 2) The period in minutes that the handler will wait between connection checks and connection attempts
- `timeout` (0-60, default = 5) The period in minutes after which the connection will be reset if no valid messages have been received. Set to 0 to disable.

Thing config file example:

```java
Bridge alarmdecoder:ipbridge:ad1 [ hostname="cerberus.home", tcpPort=10000, discovery=true ] {
  Thing ...
  Thing ...
}
```

### serialbridge

The `serialbridge` thing supports a serial or USB connection to an Alarm Decoder device such as _AD2SERIAL_ or _AD2USB_.

Parameters:

- `serialPort` (required) The name of the serial port used to connect to the Alarm Decoder device
- `bitrate` Speed of the serial connection
- `discovery` (default=false) Enable automatic discovery of zones and RF zones

Thing config file example:

```java
Bridge alarmdecoder:serialbridge:ad1 [ serialPort="/dev/ttyS1", bitrate=115200, discovery=true ] {
  Thing ...
  Thing ...
}
```

### keypad

The `keypad` thing reports keypad status and optionally sends keypad messages.
For panels that support multiple keypad addresses, it can be configured with an address mask of one or more keypad(s) for which it will receive messages.
When sending messages, it will send from the configured keypad address if only one is configured.
If a mask containing multiple addresses or 0 (all) is configured, it will send messages from the Alarm Decoder's configured address.

Commands sent from the keypad thing are limited to the set of valid keypad command characters supported by the Alarm Decoder (0-9,*,#,<,>).
In addition, the characters A-H will be translated to special keys 1-8.
Command strings containing invalid characters will be ignored.

Parameters:

- `addressMask` (default = 0) String containing the mask in hex of addresses for which the keypad thing will receive messages (0 = all addresses).
- `sendCommands` (default = false) Allow keypad commands to be sent to the alarm system from openHAB. Enabling this means the alarm system will be only as secure as your openHAB system.
- `sendStar` (default = false) When disarmed/faulted, automatically send the * character to obtain zone fault information.
- `commandMapping` (optional) Comma separated list of key/value pairs mapping integers to command strings for `intcommand` channel.

Address masks

Each bit in the 4 bytes of the address mask represents a device address, ranging from device 0 to device 31.
The first byte (left to right) represents devices 0-7, the second 8-15, the third 16-23, and the fourth 24-31.
The mask itself is represented as a string containing a hexadecimal number.
For example, a mask of 03000000 would indicate devices 0 and 1 as follows:

```text
Mask: 03000000
Bytes: 03       00       00       00
Bits:  00000011 00000000 00000000 00000000
       -------- -------- -------- --------
Device#         111111   22221111 33222222
       76543210 54321098 32109876 10987654
```

Thing config file example:

```java
  Thing keypad keypad1 [ addressMask=0, sendCommands=true ]
```

### zone

The `zone` thing reports status from zone expanders and relay expanders, and also from built-in zones via emulation.

Parameters:

- `address` (required) Zone address
- `channel` (required) Zone channel

Thing config file example:

```java
  Thing zone frontdoor [ address=10, channel=1 ]
```

### rfzone

The `rfzone` thing reports status from wireless zones, such as 5800 series RF devices, if your alarm panel has an RF receiver.

Parameters:

- `serial` (required) Serial number of the RF zone

Thing config file example:

```java
  Thing rfzone motion1 [ serial=0180010 ]
```

### vzone

The `vzone` thing sends open/close commands a virtual zone.
After enabling zone expander emulation on both the alarm panel and the Alarm Decoder device, it can be used to control the state of a virtual zone.
The `command` channel is write-only, and accepts either the string "OPEN" or the string "CLOSED".
The `state` channel is a switch type channel that reflects the current state of the virtual zone (ON=closed/OFF=open).

Parameters:

- `address` (required) Virtual zone number (0-99)

Thing config file example:

```java
  Thing vzone watersensor [ address=41 ]
```

### lrr

The `lrr` thing reports messages sent to a Long Range Radio (LRR) or emulated LRR device.
These are normally specifically formatted messages as described in the [SIA DC-05-1999.09](https://www.alarmdecoder.com/wiki/index.php/File:SIA-ContactIDCodes_Protocol.pdf) standard for Contact ID reporting.
They can also, depending on configuration, be other types of messages as described [here](https://www.alarmdecoder.com/wiki/index.php/LRR_Support).
For panels that support multiple partitions, the partition for which a given lrr thing will receive messages can be defined.

- `partition` (default = 0) Partition for which to receive LRR events (0 = All)

Thing config file example:

```java
  Thing lrr lrr [ partition=0 ]
```

## Thing Actions

The `ipbridge` and `serialbridge` things expose the following action to the automation engine:

_reboot_ - Send command to reboot the Alarm Decoder device. Accepts no parameters.

## Quirks

The alarmdecoder device cannot query the panel for the state of individual zones.
For this reason, the binding puts contacts into the "unknown" state (UNDEF), _until the panel goes into the READY state_.
At that point, all contacts for which no update messages have arrived are presumed to be in the CLOSED state.
In other words: to get to a clean slate after an openHAB restart, close all doors/windows such that the panel is READY.
