# HCC Rubbish Collection Binding

A Hamilton City Council (NZ) _"Fight the Landfill"_ binding.
This binding will keep track of your rubbish collection days and uses the [Fight the Landfill](https://www.fightthelandfill.co.nz/) website API to fetch the upcoming collection dates.

## Supported Things

A single supported thing called `collection`.

## Thing Configuration

The thing supports one setting labelled `address` which is your street number and name as it appears on Google.
_For Example:
1 Victoria Street_

> Note: The above address example is not valid as it is a business address.

_If the address is not valid or rubbish collection service does not apply (for example, a business address) then a `CONFIGURATION_ERROR` will occur._

#### Configuration

You can set an `offset` in minutes.
This can then trigger the collection event before or after the normal time of 12:00am on the day of the collection.

_For Example:
If you want the event to trigger at 7pm the day before, to remind you to take out the bins, then set the `offset` to `-300` (5 hours x 60 minutes)._
