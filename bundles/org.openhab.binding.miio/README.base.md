This binding is used to control Xiaomi products implementing the Mi IO protocol. 
This is a set of wifi devices from Xiaomi that are part of the Mi Ecosystem which is branded as MiJia.

## Supported Things

The following things types are available:

| ThingType        | Description                                                                                                              |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| miio:generic     | Generic type for discovered devices. Once the token is available and the device model is determined, this ThingType will automatically change to the appropriate ThingType |
| miio:vacuum      | For Xiaomi Robot Vacuum products                                                                                         |
| miio:basic       | For several basic devices like yeelights, airpurifiers. Channels and commands are determined by database configuration   |
| miio:unsupported | For experimenting with other devices which use the Mi IO protocol                                                        |

## Mi IO Devices

# Discovery

The binding has 2 methods for discovering devices. Depending on your network setup and the device model, your device may be discovered by one or both methods. If both methods discover your device, 2 discovery results may be in your inbox for the same device.

The mDNS discovery method will discover your device type, but will not discover a (required) token.
The basic discovery will not discovery the type, but will discover a token for models that support it.
Accept only one of the 2 discovery results, the alternate one can further be ignored.

## Tokens

The binding needs a token from the Xiaomi Mi Device in order to be able to control it.
Some devices provide the token upon discovery. This may depends on the firmware version.

If the device does not discover your token, it needs to be retrieved from the Mi Home app.
Note: latest Android MiHome no longer has the tokens in the database. Use 5.0.19 version or lower 
The token needs to be retrieved from the application database. The easiest way on Android to do is by using [MiToolkit](https://github.com/ultrara1n/MiToolkit/releases).

Alternatively, on Android open a backup file, or browse a rooted device, find the mio2db file with and read it sqlite.

For iPhone, use an un-encrypted iTunes-Backup and unpack it and use a sqlite tool to view the files in it: 
Then search in "RAW, com.xiaomi.home," for "USERID_mihome.sqlite" and look for the 32-digit-token or 96 digit encrypted token.

Note. The Xiaomi devices change the token when inclusion is done. Hence if you get your token after reset and than include it with the Mi Home app, the token will change.

## Binding Configuration

No binding configuration is required.

## Thing Configuration

Each Xiaomi device (thing) needs the IP address and token configured to be able to communicate. See discovery for details.
Optional configuration is the refresh interval and the deviceID. Note that the deviceID is automatically retrieved when it is left blank.
The configuration for model is automatically retrieved from the device in normal operation. 
However, for devices that are unsupported, you may override the value and try to use a model string from a similar device to experimentally use your device with the binding.

| Parameter       | Type    | Required | Description                                                       |
|-----------------|---------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| host            | text    | true     | Device IP address                                                 |
| token           | text    | true     | Token for communication (in Hex)                                  |
| deviceId        | text    | true     | Device ID number for communication (in Hex)                       |
| model           | text    | false    | Device model string, used to determine the subtype                |
| refreshInterval | integer | false    | Refresh interval for refreshing the data in seconds. (0=disabled) |
| timeout         | integer | false    | Timeout time in milliseconds                                      |


### Example Thing file

`Thing miio:basic:light "My Light" [ host="192.168.x.x", token="put here your token", deviceId="0326xxxx" ]` 

## Channels

Depending on the device, different channels are available.

All devices have available the following channels (marked as advanced) besides the device specific channels

| Channel          | Type    | Description                         |
|------------------|---------|-------------------------------------|
| network#ssid     | String  | Network SSID                        |
| network#bssid    | String  | Network BSSID                       |
| network#rssi     | Number  | Network RSSI                        |
| network#life     | Number  | Network Life                        |
| actions#commands | String  | send commands. see below            |

note: the ADVANCED  `actions#commands` channel can be used to send commands that are not automated via the binding. This is available for all devices
e.g. `smarthome:send actionCommand 'upd_timer["1498595904821", "on"]'` would enable a pre-configured timer. See https://github.com/marcelrv/XiaomiRobotVacuumProtocol for all known available commands.
