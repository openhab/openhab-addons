     * &gt; [!NOTE]
     * &gt; due to the maximum size of this list and to the fact that the entries may include strings (see

     * When removing entries in the SupportedAreas attribute list the server shall adjust the values of the
     * SelectedAreas, CurrentArea, and Progress attributes such that they only reference valid entries in the updated
     * SupportedAreas attribute list. These changes to the SelectedAreas, CurrentArea, and Progress attributes may

     * available to the clients.
     * The SupportedAreas attribute list changes mentioned above SHOULD NOT be allowed while the device is operating, to
     * reduce the impact on the clients, and the potential confusion for the users.

     * • a two level home may be represented using two maps, one for each level
     * • a single level home may be represented using two maps, each including a different set of rooms, such as
     * &quot;map of living room and kitchen&quot; and &quot;map of bedrooms and hallway&quot;
     * • a single level home may be represented using one map for the indoor areas (living room, bedrooms etc.) and one
     * for the outdoor areas (garden, swimming pool etc.)
     * Each map includes one or more areas - see the SupportedAreas attribute. In the context of this cluster
     * specification, a map is effectively a group label for a set of areas, rather than a graphical representation that
     * the clients can display to the users. The clients that present the list of available areas for user selection
     * (see the SelectAreas command) may choose to filter the SupportedAreas list based on the associated map. For
     * example, the clients may allow the user to indicate that the device is to operate on the first floor, and allow
     * the user to choose only from the areas situated on that level.
     * If empty, that indicates that the device is currently unable to provide this information. Each entry in this list

     * the SupportedLocations attribute shall be updated such that all entries in that list meet the constraints
     * indicated in the description of the SupportedLocations attribute. This may result in the server removing entries
