     * the water, the tank volume and target temperature.
     * For example, if the target temperature was 60°C, the current temperature was 20°C and the tank volume was 100L:
     * ### Mass of water &#x3D; 1kg per Litre
     * Total Mass &#x3D; 100 x 1kg &#x3D; 100kg
     * Δ Temperature &#x3D; (target temperature - current temperature)
     * &#x3D; (60°C - 20°C) &#x3D; 40°C
     * ### Energy required to
     * heat the water to 60°C &#x3D; 4182 x 40 x 100 &#x3D; 16,728,000 J
     * Converting Joules in to Wh of heat (divide by 3600):
     * &#x3D; 16,728,000 J / 3600
     * &#x3D; 4647 Wh (4.65kWh)
     * If the TankPercent feature is supported, then this estimate shall also take into account the percentage of the
     * water in the tank which is already hot.
     * &gt; [!NOTE]
     * &gt; The electrical energy required to heat the water depends on the heating system used to heat the water. For
     * example, a direct electric immersion heating element can be close to 100% efficient, so the electrical energy
     * needed to heat the hot water is nearly the same as the EstimatedHeatEnergyRequired. However some forms of
     * heating, such as an air-source heat pump which extracts heat from ambient air, requires much less electrical
     * energy to heat hot water. Heat pumps can be produce 3kWh of heat output for 1kWh of electrical energy input. The
     * conversion between heat energy and electrical energy is outside the scope of this cluster.

     * Indicates an approximate level of hot water stored in the tank, which might help consumers understand the amount
     * of hot water remaining in the tank. The accuracy of this attribute is manufacturer specific.
     * In most hot water tanks, there is a stratification effect where the hot water layer rests above a cooler layer of
     * water below. For this reason cold water is fed in at the bottom of the tank and the hot water is drawn from the
     * top.
     * Some water tanks might use multiple temperature probes to estimate the level of the hot water layer. A water
     * heater with multiple temperature probes is likely to implement an algorithm to estimate the hot water tank
     * percentage by taking into account the temperature values of each probe to determine the height of the hot water.
     * However it might be possible with a single temperature probe to estimate how much hot water is left using a
     * simpler algorithm:
     * For example, if the target temperature was 60°C, the CurrentTemperature was 40°C from a single temperature probe
     * measuring the average water temperature and the temperature of incoming cold water (COLD_WATER_TEMP) was assumed
     * to be 20°C:
     * TankPercentage &#x3D; int(((current temperature - COLD_WATER_TEMP) / (target temperature - COLD_WATER_TEMP)) *
     * 100)
