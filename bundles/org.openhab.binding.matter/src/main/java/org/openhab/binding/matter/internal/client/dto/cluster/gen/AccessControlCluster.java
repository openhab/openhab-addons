         * The service associated with the device vendor may perform vendor ID verification on the fabric from which the

         * • The device using this mechanism shall provide a service at the URL that can accept requests for additional
         * access and return responses indicating whether the requests were granted or denied.
         * • This URL will typically lead to a server which (e.g. by looking at the User-Agent) redirects the user to
         * allow viewing, downloading, installing or using a manufacturer-provided means for guiding the user through
         * the process to review and approve or deny the request. The device manufacturer may choose to use a
         * constructed URL which is valid in a HTTP GET request (i.e. dedicated for the product) such as, for example,
         * https://domain.example/arl-app?vid&#x3D;FFF1&amp; pid&#x3D;1234. If a client follows or launches the
         * ARLRequestFlowUrl, it shall expand it as described in Section 9.10.9.3.4, “ARLRequestFlowUrl format”.
         * • A manufacturer contemplating using this flow should realize that
         * ◦ This flow typically requires internet access to access the URL, and access extension may fail when internet
         * connectivity is not available.
         * ◦ If the flow prefers to redirect the user to an app which is available on popular platforms, it SHOULD also
         * provide a fallback option such as a web browser interface to ensure users can complete access extension.
         * ### ARLRequestFlowUrl format
         * The ARLRequestFlowUrl shall contain a query component (see RFC 3986 section 3.4) composed of one or more
         * key-value pairs:
         * • The query shall use the &amp; delimiter between key/value pairs.
         * • The key-value pairs shall in the format name&#x3D;&lt;value&gt; where name is the key name, and
         * &lt;value&gt; is the contents of the value encoded with proper URL-encoded escaping.
         * • If key MTcu is present, it shall have a value of &quot;_&quot; (i.e. MTcu&#x3D;_). This is the
         * &quot;callback URL (CallbackUrl) placeholder&quot;.
         * • Any key whose name begins with MT not mentioned in the previous bullets shall be reserved for future use by
         * this specification. Manufacturers shall NOT include query keys starting with MT in the ARLRequestFlowUrl
         * unless they are referenced by a version of this specification.
         * Any other element in the ARLRequestFlowUrl query field not covered by the above rules, as well as the
         * fragment field (if present), shall remain including the order of query key/value pairs present.
         * Once the URL is obtained, it shall be expanded to form a final URL (ExpandedARLRequestFlowUrl) by proceeding
         * with the following substitution algorithm on the original ARLRequestFlowUrl:
         * 1. If key MTcu is present, compute the CallbackUrl desired (see Section 9.10.9.3.5, “CallbackUrl format for
         * ARL Request Flow response”), and substitute the placeholder value &quot;_&quot; (i.e. in MTcu&#x3D;_) in the
         * ARLRequestFlowUrl with the desired contents, encoded with proper URL-encoded escaping (see RFC 3986 section
         * 2).
         * The final URL after expansion (ExpandedARLRequestFlowUrl) shall be the one to follow, rather than the
         * original value obtained from the FabricRestrictionReviewUpdate event.
         * ### CallbackUrl format for ARL Request Flow response
         * If a CallbackUrl field (i.e. MTcu&#x3D;) query field placeholder is present in the ARLRequestFlowUrl, the
         * client may replace the placeholder value &quot;_&quot; in the ExpandedARLRequestFlowUrl with a URL that the
         * manufacturer flow can use to make a smooth return to the client when the ARL flow has terminated.
         * This URL field may contain a query component (see RFC 3986 section 3.4). If a query is present, it shall be
         * composed of one or more key-value pairs:
         * • The query shall use the &amp; delimiter between key/value pairs.
         * • The key-value pairs shall follow the format name&#x3D;&lt;value&gt; where name is the key name, and
         * &lt;value&gt; is the contents of the value encoded with proper URL-encoded escaping.
         * • If key MTaer is present, it shall have a value of &quot;_&quot; (i.e. MTaer&#x3D;_). This is the
         * placeholder for a &quot;access extension response&quot; provided by the manufacturer flow to the client. The
         * manufacturer flow shall replace this placeholder with the final status of the access extension request, which
         * shall be formatted following Expansion of CallbackUrl by the manufacturer custom flow and encoded with proper
         * URL-encoded escaping.
         * • Any key whose name begins with MT not mentioned in the previous bullets shall be reserved for future use by
         * this specification.
         * Any other element in the CallbackUrl query field not covered by the above rules, as well as the fragment
         * field (if present), shall remain as provided by the client through embedding within the
         * ExpandedARLRequestFlowUrl, including the order of query key/value pairs present.
         * Once the CallbackUrl is obtained by the manufacturer flow, it may be expanded to form a final
         * ExpandedARLRequestCallbackUrl URL to be used by proceeding with the following substitution algorithm on the
         * provided CallbackUrl:
         * • If key MTaer is present, the manufacturer custom flow having received the initial query containing the
         * CallbackUrl shall substitute the placeholder value &quot;_&quot; (i.e. in MTaer&#x3D;_) in the CallbackUrl
         * with the final status of the access extension request flow which shall be one of the following. Any value
         * returned in the MTaer field not listed above shall be considered an error and shall be treated as
         * GeneralFailure.
         * ◦ Success - The flow completed successfully and the ARL attribute was updated. The client may now read the
         * ARL attribute to determine the new access restrictions.
         * ◦ NoChange - The ARL attribute was already listing minimum restrictions for the requesting fabric.
         * ◦ GeneralFailure - The flow failed for an unspecified reason.
         * ◦ FlowAuthFailure - The user failed to authenticate to the flow.
         * ◦ NotFound - Access extension failed because the target fabric was not found.
         * A manufacturer custom flow having received an ExpandedARLRequestFlowUrl SHOULD attempt to open the
         * ExpandedARLRequestCallbackUrl, on completion of the request, if an ExpandedARLRequestCallbackUrl was computed
         * from the CallbackUrl and opening such a URL is supported.
         * ### Examples of ARLRequestFlowUrl URLs
         * Below are some examples of valid ExpandedARLRequestFlowUrl for several valid values of ARLRequestFlowUrl, as
         * well as some examples of invalid values of ARLRequestFlowUrl:
         * • Invalid URL with no query string: http scheme is not allowed:
         * ◦ http://company.domain.example/matter/arl/vFFF1p1234
         * • Valid URL :
         * ◦ https://company.domain.example/matter/arl/vFFF1p1234
         * • Valid URL, CallbackUrl requested:
         * ◦ Before expansion:
         * https://company.domain.example/matter/arl?vid&#x3D;FFF1&amp;pid&#x3D;1234&amp;MTcu&#x3D;_
         * ◦ After expansion:
         * https://company.domain.example/matter/arl?vid&#x3D;FFF1&amp;pid&#x3D;1234&amp;MTcu&#x3D;https%3A%2F%2Fc
         * lient.domain.example%2Fcb%3Ftoken%3DmAsJ6_vqbr-vjDiG_w%253D%253D%26MTaer%3D_
         * ◦ The ExpandedARLRequestFlowUrl URL contains:
         * ▪ A CallbackUrl with a client-provided arbitrary token&#x3D; key/value pair and the MTaer&#x3D; key/value
         * pair place-holder to indicate support for a return access extension completion status:
         * https://client.domain.example/cb?token&#x3D;mAsJ6_vqbr-vjDiG_w%3D%3D&amp;MTaer&#x3D;_
         * ▪ After expansion of the CallbackUrl (MTcu key) into an ExpandedCallbackUrl, with an example return access
         * extension completion status of Success, the ExpandedARLRequestCallbackUrl would be:
         * https://client.domain.example/cb?token&#x3D;mAsJ6_vqbr-vjDiG_w%3D%3D&amp;MTaer&#x3D;Success
         * Note that the MTcu key/value pair was initially provided URL-encoded within the ExpandedARLRequestFlowUrl URL
         * and the MTaer&#x3D;_ key/value pair placeholder now contains a substituted returned completion status.
         * • Invalid URL, due to MTza&#x3D;79 key/value pair in reserved MT-prefixed keys reserved for future use:

         * 
         * This feature is for a device that is managed by a service associated with the device vendor and which imposes
         * default access restrictions upon each new fabric added to it. This could arise, for example, if the device is
         * managed by a service provider under contract to an end-user, in such a way that the manager of the device
         * does not unconditionally grant universal access to all of a device’s functionality, even for fabric
         * administrators. For example, many Home Routers are managed by an Internet Service Provider (a service), and
         * these services often have a policy that requires them to obtain user consent before certain administrative
         * functions can be delegated to a third party (e.g., a fabric Administrator). These restrictions are expressed
         * using an Access Restriction List (ARL).
         * The purpose of this feature on the Access Control cluster is to indicate to a fabric Administrator that
         * access by it to specific attributes, commands and/or events for specific clusters is currently prohibited.
         * Attempts to access these restricted data model elements shall result in an error of ACCESS_RESTRICTED.
         * A device that implements this feature shall have a mechanism to honor the ReviewFabricRestrictions command,
         * such as user interfaces or service interactions associated with a service provider or the device
         * manufacturer, which allows the owner (or subscriber) to manage access restrictions for each fabric. The user
         * interface design, which includes the way restrictions are organized and presented to the user, is not
         * specified, but SHOULD be usable by non-expert end-users from common mobile devices, personal computers, or an
         * on-device user interface.
         * Controllers and clients SHOULD incorporate generic handling of the ACCESS_RESTRICTED error code, when it
         * appears in allowed contexts, in order to gracefully handle situations where this feature is encountered.
         * Device vendors that adopt this feature SHOULD be judicious in its use given the risk of unexpected behavior
         * in controllers and clients.
         * For certification testing, a device that implements this feature shall provide a way for all restrictions to
         * be removed.
         * The ARL attribute provides the set of restrictions currently applied to this fabric.
         * The ReviewFabricRestrictions command provides a way for the fabric Administrator to request that the server
         * triggers a review of the current fabric restrictions, by involving external entities such as end-users, or
         * other services associated with the manager of the device hosting the server. This review process may involve
         * communication between external services and the user, and may take an unpredictable amount of time to
         * complete since an end-user may need to visit some resources, such as a mobile application or web site. A
         * FabricRestrictionReviewUpdate event will be generated by the device within a predictable time period of the
         * ReviewFabricRestrictionsResponse (see ReviewFabricRestrictions for specification of this time period), and
         * this event can be correlated with the ReviewFabricRestrictionsResponse using a token provided in both. The
         * device may provide instructions or a Redirect URL in the FabricRestrictionReviewUpdate event in order to help
         * the user access the features required for managing per-fabric restrictions.
         * See Section 6.6.2, “Model” for a description of how access control is impacted by the ARL attribute.
         * ### Managed Device Feature Usage Restrictions
         * Use of this feature shall be limited to the mandatory clusters of endpoints having a device type that
         * explicitly permits its use in the Device Library Specification. As a reminder, the device types associated
         * with an endpoint are listed in the Descriptor cluster of the endpoint.
         * In addition, use of this feature shall NOT restrict the following clusters on any endpoint:
         * 1. the Descriptor Cluster (0x001D)
         * 2. the Binding Cluster (0x001E)
         * 3. the Network Commissioning Cluster (0x0031)
         * 4. the Identify Cluster (0x0003)
         * 5. the Groups Cluster (0x0004)
         * In addition, use of this feature shall NOT restrict the global attributes of any cluster.
         * Because ARLs cannot be used to restrict root node access or access to any clusters required for
         * commissioning, administrators may determine the current restrictions of the ARL at any point, including
         * during commissioning after joining the fabric.
