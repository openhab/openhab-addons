     * the state of all epoch keys.
     * ### Effect on Receipt
     * The following validations shall be done against the content of the GroupKeySet field:
     * • If the EpochKey0 field is null or its associated EpochStartTime0 field is null, then this command shall fail
     * with an INVALID_COMMAND status code responded to the client.
     * • If the EpochKey0 field’s length is not exactly 16 bytes, then this command shall fail with a CONSTRAINT_ERROR
     * status code responded to the client.
     * • If the EpochStartTime0 is set to 0, then this command shall fail with an INVALID_COMMAND status code responded
     * to the client. Note that internally, a GroupKeySetStruct’s EpochStartTime0 may be set to zero, due to the
     * behavior of the AddNOC command which synthesizes a GroupKeySetStruct (see IPKValue). However, the value 0 is
     * illegal in the GroupKeySet field sent by a client.
     * • If the EpochKey1 field is not null, then the EpochKey0 field shall NOT be null. Otherwise this command shall
     * fail with an INVALID_COMMAND status code responded to the client.
     * • If the EpochKey1 field is not null, and the field’s length is not exactly 16 bytes, then this command shall
     * fail with a CONSTRAINT_ERROR status code responded to the client.
     * • If the EpochKey1 field is not null, its associated EpochStartTime1 field shall NOT be null and shall contain a
     * later epoch start time than the epoch start time found in the EpochStartTime0 field. Otherwise this command shall
     * fail with an INVALID_COMMAND status code responded to the client.
     * • If exactly one of the EpochKey1 or EpochStartTime1 is null, rather than both being null, or neither being null,
     * then this command shall fail with an INVALID_COMMAND status code responded to the client.
     * • If the EpochKey2 field is not null, then the EpochKey1 and EpochKey0 fields shall NOT be null. Otherwise this
     * command shall fail with an INVALID_COMMAND status code responded to the client.
     * • If the EpochKey2 field is not null, and the field’s length is not exactly 16 bytes, then this command shall
     * fail with a CONSTRAINT_ERROR status code responded to the client.
     * • If the EpochKey2 field is not null, its associated EpochStartTime2 field shall NOT be null and shall contain a
     * later epoch start time than the epoch start time found in the EpochStartTime1 field. Otherwise this command shall
     * fail with an INVALID_COMMAND status code responded to the client.
     * • If exactly one of the EpochKey2 or EpochStartTime2 is null, rather than both being null, or neither being null,
     * then this command shall fail with an INVALID_COMMAND status code responded to the client.
     * If there exists a Group Key Set associated with the accessing fabric which has the same GroupKeySetID as that
     * provided in the GroupKeySet field, then the contents of that group key set shall be replaced. A replacement shall
     * be done by executing the equivalent of entirely removing the previous Group Key Set with the given GroupKeySetID,
     * followed by an addition of a Group Key Set with the provided configuration. Otherwise, if the GroupKeySetID did
     * not match an existing entry, a new Group Key Set associated with the accessing fabric shall be created with the
     * provided data. The Group Key Set shall be written to non-volatile storage.
     * Upon completion, this command shall send a status code back to the initiator:
     * • If the Group Key Set was properly installed or updated on the Node, the status code shall be set to SUCCESS.
     * • If there are insufficient resources on the receiver to store an additional Group Key Set, the status code shall
     * be set to RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED (see group key limits);
