     * over a CASE session, the command shall leave the current fail-safe state unchanged and immediately respond with
     * an ArmFailSafeResponse containing an ErrorCode value of BusyWithOtherAdmin. This is done to allow commissioners,
     * which use PASE connections, the opportunity to use the failsafe during the relatively short commissioning window.

     * of ExpiryLengthSeconds, or disarm it, depending on the situation:
     * • If ExpiryLengthSeconds is 0 and the fail-safe timer was already armed and the accessing fabric matches the
     * Fabric currently associated with the fail-safe context, then the fail-safe timer shall be immediately expired
     * (see further below for side-effects of expiration).
     * • If ExpiryLengthSeconds is 0 and the fail-safe timer was not armed, then this command invocation shall lead to a
     * success response with no side-effects against the fail-safe context.
     * • If ExpiryLengthSeconds is non-zero and the fail-safe timer was not currently armed, then the fail-safe timer
     * shall be armed for that duration.
     * • If ExpiryLengthSeconds is non-zero and the fail-safe timer was currently armed, and the accessing Fabric
     * matches the fail-safe context’s associated Fabric, then the fail-safe timer shall be re-armed to expire in
     * ExpiryLengthSeconds.
     * • Otherwise, the command shall leave the current fail-safe state unchanged and immediately respond with
     * ArmFailSafeResponse containing an ErrorCode value of BusyWithOtherAdmin, indicating a likely conflict between
     * commissioners.
     * The value of the Breadcrumb field shall be written to the Breadcrumb on successful execution of the command.
     * If the receiver restarts unexpectedly (e.g., power interruption, software crash, or other reset) the receiver
     * shall behave as if the fail-safe timer expired and perform the sequence of clean-up steps listed below.
     * On successful execution of the command, the ErrorCode field of the ArmFailSafeResponse shall be set to OK.
     * ### Fail Safe Context
     * When first arming the fail-safe timer, a &#x27;Fail Safe Context&#x27; shall be created on the receiver, to track
     * the following state information while the fail-safe is armed:
     * • The fail-safe timer duration.
     * • The state of all Network Commissioning Networks attribute configurations, to allow recovery of connectivity
     * after Fail-Safe expiry.
     * • Whether an AddNOC command or UpdateNOC command has taken place.
     * • A Fabric Index for the fabric-scoping of the context, starting at the accessing fabric index for the
     * ArmFailSafe command, and updated with the Fabric Index associated with an AddNOC command or an UpdateNOC command
     * being invoked successfully during the ongoing Fail-Safe timer period.
     * • The operational credentials associated with any Fabric whose configuration is affected by the UpdateNOC
     * command.
     * • Optionally: the previous state of non-fabric-scoped data that is mutated during the fail-safe period.
     * Note the following to assist in understanding the above state-keeping, which summarizes other normative
     * requirements in the respective sections:
     * • The AddNOC command can only be invoked once per contiguous non-expiring fail-safe timer period, and only if no
     * UpdateNOC command was previously processed within the same fail-safe timer period.
     * • The UpdateNOC command can only be invoked once per contiguous non-expiring fail-safe timer period, can only be
     * invoked over a CASE session, and only if no AddNOC command was previously processed in the same fail-safe timer
     * period.
     * On creation of the Fail Safe Context a second timer shall be created to expire at MaxCumulativeFailsafeSeconds as
     * specified in BasicCommissioningInfo. This Cumulative Fail Safe Context timer (CFSC timer) serves to limit the
     * lifetime of any particular Fail Safe Context; it shall NOT be extended or modified on subsequent invocations of
     * ArmFailSafe associated with this Fail Safe Context. Upon expiry of the CFSC timer, the receiver shall execute
     * cleanup behavior equivalent to that of fail-safe timer expiration as detailed in Section 11.10.7.2.2, “Behavior
     * on expiry of Fail-Safe timer”. Termination of the session prior to the expiration of that timer for any reason
     * (including a successful end of commissioning or an expiry of a fail-safe timer) shall also delete the CFSC timer.
     * ### Behavior on expiry of Fail-Safe timer
     * If the fail-safe timer expires before the CommissioningComplete command is successfully invoked, the following
     * sequence of clean-up steps shall be executed, in order, by the receiver:
     * 1. Terminate any open PASE secure session by clearing any associated Secure Session Context at the Server.
     * 2. Revoke the temporary administrative privileges granted to any open PASE session (see Section 6.6.2.9,
     * “Bootstrapping of the Access Control Cluster”) at the Server.
     * 3. If an AddNOC or UpdateNOC command has been successfully invoked, terminate all CASE sessions associated with
     * the Fabric whose Fabric Index is recorded in the Fail-Safe context (see ArmFailSafe) by clearing any associated
     * Secure Session Context at the Server.
     * 4. Reset the configuration of all Network Commissioning Networks attribute to their state prior to the Fail-Safe
     * being armed.
     * 5. If an UpdateNOC command had been successfully invoked, revert the state of operational key pair, NOC and ICAC
     * for that Fabric to the state prior to the Fail-Safe timer being armed, for the Fabric Index that was the subject
     * of the UpdateNOC command.
     * 6. If an AddNOC command had been successfully invoked, achieve the equivalent effect of invoking the RemoveFabric
     * command against the Fabric Index stored in the Fail-Safe Context for the Fabric Index that was the subject of the
     * AddNOC command. This shall remove all associations to that Fabric including all fabric-scoped data, and may
     * possibly factory-reset the device depending on current device state. This shall only apply to Fabrics added
     * during the fail-safe period as the result of the AddNOC command.
     * 7. If the CSRRequest command had been successfully invoked, but no AddNOC or UpdateNOC command had been
     * successfully invoked, then the new operational key pair temporarily generated for the purposes of NOC addition or
     * update (see Node Operational CSR Procedure) shall be removed as it is no longer needed.
     * 8. Remove any RCACs added by the AddTrustedRootCertificate command that are not currently referenced by any entry
     * in the Fabrics attribute.
     * 9. Reset the Breadcrumb attribute to zero.
     * 10. Optionally: if no factory-reset resulted from the previous steps, it is recommended that the Node rollback
     * the state of all non fabric-scoped data present in the Fail-Safe context.

     * • If no AddNOC command had been successfully invoked, the CommissioningComplete command must originate from the
     * Fabric that initiated the Fail-Safe context.
     * • After an AddNOC command has been successfully invoked, the CommissioningComplete command must originate from
     * the Fabric which was joined through the execution of that command, which updated the Fail-Safe context’s Fabric
     * Index.
     * On successful execution of the CommissioningComplete command, where the CommissioningCompleteResponse has an
     * ErrorCode of OK, the following actions shall be undertaken on the Server:
     * 1. The Fail-Safe timer associated with the current Fail-Safe context shall be disarmed.
     * 2. The commissioning window at the Server shall be closed.
     * 3. Any temporary administrative privileges automatically granted to any open PASE session shall be revoked (see
     * Section 6.6.2.9, “Bootstrapping of the Access Control Cluster”).
     * 4. The Secure Session Context of any PASE session still established at the Server shall be cleared.
     * 5. The Breadcrumb attribute shall be reset to zero.
     * After receipt of a CommissioningCompleteResponse with an ErrorCode value of OK, a client cannot expect any
     * previously established PASE session to still be usable, due to the server having cleared such sessions.
