     * ### Effect When Received
     * If this command is received without an armed fail-safe context (see ArmFailSafe), then this command shall fail
     * with a FAILSAFE_REQUIRED status code sent back to the initiator.
     * If a prior UpdateNOC or AddNOC command was successfully executed within the fail-safe timer period, then this
     * command shall fail with a CONSTRAINT_ERROR status code sent back to the initiator.
     * If a prior AddTrustedRootCertificate command was successfully invoked within the fail-safe timer period, then
     * this command shall fail with a CONSTRAINT_ERROR status code sent back to the initiator, since the only valid
     * following logical operation is invoking the AddNOC command.
     * If the prior CSRRequest state that preceded UpdateNOC had the IsForUpdateNOC field indicated as false, then this
     * command shall fail with a CONSTRAINT_ERROR status code sent back to the initiator.
     * If any of the following conditions arise, the Node shall process an error by responding with an NOCResponse with
     * a StatusCode of InvalidNOC as described in Section 11.18.6.7.2, “Handling Errors”:
     * • The NOC provided in the NOCValue does not refer in its subject to the FabricID associated with the accessing
     * fabric.
     * • The ICAC provided in the ICACValue (if present) has a FabricID in its subject that does not match the FabricID
     * associated with the accessing fabric.
     * Otherwise, the command is considered an update of existing credentials for a given Fabric, and the following
     * shall apply:
     * 1. The Operational Certificate under the accessing fabric index in the NOCs list shall be updated to match the
     * incoming NOCValue and ICACValue (if present), such that the Node’s Operational Identifier within the Fabric
     * immediately changes.
     * a. The operational key pair associated with the incoming NOC from the NOCValue, and generated by the prior
     * CSRRequest command, shall be committed to permanent storage, for subsequent use during CASE.
     * b. The operational discovery service record shall immediately reflect the new Operational Identifier.
     * c. All internal data reflecting the prior operational identifier of the Node within the Fabric shall be revoked
     * and removed, to an outcome equivalent to the disappearance of the prior Node, except for the ongoing CASE session
     * context, which shall temporarily remain valid until the NOCResponse has been successfully delivered or until the
     * next transport-layer error, so that the response can be received by the Administrator invoking the command.
     * Thereafter, the Node shall respond with an NOCResponse with a StatusCode of OK and a FabricIndex field matching
     * the FabricIndex under which the updated NOC is scoped.
