     * SystemMode attribute value that provides the highest stage of heating (e.g., emergency heat) and continue
     * operating in that running state until the OccupiedHeatingSetpoint value is reached. For example:
     * • Calculated Local Temperature &#x3D; 10.0°C
     * • OccupiedHeatingSetpoint &#x3D; 16.0°C
     * • EmergencyHeatDelta &#x3D; 2.0°C

     * ⇒ 16°C - 10°C ≥? 2°C
     * ⇒ TRUE &gt;&gt;&gt; Thermostat server changes its SystemMode to operate in 2nd stage or emergency heat mode
     * The purpose of this attribute is to provide Thermostat clients the ability to configure rapid heating when a
     * setpoint is of a specified amount greater than the measured temperature. This allows the heated space to be
     * quickly heated to the desired level set by the user.
