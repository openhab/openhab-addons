    /**
     * This command shall attempt to connect to a network whose configuration was previously added by either the
     * AddOrUpdateWiFiNetwork or AddOrUpdateThreadNetwork commands. Network is identified by its NetworkID.
     * This command shall fail with a BUSY status code returned to the initiator if the server is currently unable to
     * proceed with such an operation, such as if it is currently attempting to connect in the background, or is already
     * proceeding with a prior ConnectNetwork.
     * If this command is received without an armed fail-safe context (see ArmFailSafe), then this command shall fail
     * with a FAILSAFE_REQUIRED status code sent back to the initiator.
     * Before connecting to the new network, the Node shall disconnect the operational network connections managed by
     * any other Network Commissioning cluster instances (whether under the Root Node or a Secondary Network Interface),
     * where those connections are not represented by an entry in the Networks attribute of the corresponding cluster
     * instance. This ensures that an Administrator or Commissioner can reliably reconfigure the operational network
     * connection of a device that has one or more Secondary Network interfaces, for example by removing the active
     * network configuration from one cluster instance, followed by adding a new configuration and calling
     * ConnectNetwork on a different cluster instance.
     * Success or failure of this command shall be communicated by the ConnectNetworkResponse command, unless some data
     * model validations caused a FAILURE status to be sent prior to finishing execution of the command. The
     * ConnectNetworkResponse shall indicate the value Success in the NetworkingStatus field on successful connection.
     * On failure to connect, the ConnectNetworkResponse shall contain an appropriate NetworkingStatus, DebugText and
     * ErrorValue indicating the reason for failure.
     * The amount of time needed to determine successful or failing connectivity on the cluster server’s associated
     * interface is provided by the ConnectMaxTimeSeconds attribute. Clients shall NOT consider the connection to have
     * timed-out until at least that duration has taken place. For non-concurrent commissioning situations, the client
     * SHOULD allow additional margin of time to account for its delay in executing operational discovery of the Node
     * once it is connected to the new network.
     * On successful connection, the entry associated with the given Network configuration in the Networks attribute
     * shall indicate its Connected field set to true, and all other entries, if any exist, shall indicate their
     * Connected field set to false.
     * On failure to connect, the entry associated with the given Network configuration in the Networks attribute shall
     * indicate its Connected field set to false.
     * The precedence order of any entry subject to ConnectNetwork shall NOT change within the Networks attribute.
     * Even after successfully connecting to a network, the configuration shall revert to the prior state of
     * configuration if the CommissioningComplete command (see CommissioningComplete) is not successfully invoked before
     * expiry of the Fail-Safe timer.
     * When non-concurrent commissioning is being used by a Commissioner or Administrator, the ConnectNetworkResponse
     * shall be sent with the NetworkingStatus field set to Success prior to closing the commissioning channel, even if
     * not yet connected to the operational network, unless the device would be incapable of joining that network, in
     * which case the usual failure path described in the prior paragraphs shall be followed. Once the commissioning
     * channel is closed, the operational channel will be started. It is possible that the only method to determine
     * success of the operation is operational discovery of the Node on the new operational network. Therefore, before
     * invoking the ConnectNetwork command, the client SHOULD re-invoke the Arm Fail-Safe command with a duration that
     * meets the following:
     * 1. Sufficient time to meet the minimum required time (see ConnectMaxTimeSeconds) that may be taken by the server
     * to connect to the desired network.
     * 2. Sufficient time to account for possible message-layer retries when a response is requested.
     * 3. Sufficient time to allow operational discovery on the new network by a Commissioner or Administrator.
     * 4. Sufficient time to establish a CASE session after operational discovery
     * 5. Not so long that, in error situations, the delay to reverting back to being discoverable for commissioning
     * with a previous configuration would cause significant user-perceived delay.
     * Note as well that the CommissioningTimeout duration provided in a prior OpenCommissioningWindow or
     * OpenBasicCommissioningWindow command may impact the total time available to proceed with error recovery after a
     * connection failure.
     * The LastNetworkingStatus, LastNetworkID and LastConnectErrorValue attributes may assist the client in determining
     * the reason for a failure after reconnecting over a Commissioning channel, especially in non-concurrent
     * commissioning situations.
