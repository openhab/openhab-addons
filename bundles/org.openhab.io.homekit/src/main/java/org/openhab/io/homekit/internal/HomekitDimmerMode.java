/**
 * Dimmer commands are handled differently by different devices.
 * Some devices expect only the brightness updates, some other expect brightness as well as "On/Off" commands.
 * This enum describes different modes of dimmer handling in the context of HomeKit binding.
 *
 * Following modes are supported:
 * DIMMER_MODE_NORMAL - no filtering. The commands will be sent to device as received from HomeKit.
 * DIMMER_MODE_FILTER_ON - ON events are filtered out. only OFF and brightness information are sent
 * DIMMER_MODE_FILTER_BRIGHTNESS_100 - only Brightness=100% is filtered out. everything else unchanged. This allows
 * custom logic for soft launch in devices.
 * DIMMER_MODE_FILTER_ON_EXCEPT_BRIGHTNESS_100 - ON events are filtered out in all cases except of Brightness = 100%.
