# EcoFlow Binding

This binding provides integration for power stations and micro inverters made by EcoFlow (<https://www.ecoflow.com/>).
It discovers devices and communicates to them by using the cloud services provided by EcoFLow.

## Supported Things

- EcoFlow cloud API (`ecoflow-api`)
- Delta 2 power station (`delta2`)
- Delta 2 Max power station (`delta2-max`)
- PowerStream micro inverter (`powerstream`)

## Discovery

At first, you need to manually create the bridge thing for the cloud API.
Once that is done, you can initiate a device scan and supported devices will be automatically discovered and added to the inbox.

## Thing Configuration

For the cloud API thing (`ecoflow-api`), you need to register for a developer account at EcoFlow's [developer page](https://developer.ecoflow.com).
Once that registration is approved, you can create access credentials under the `IoT Background` tab on that page, which you need for the thing configuration:

| Config    | Description                                |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------|
| accessKey | The access key obtained as described above |
| secretKey | The secret key obtained as described above |

Please note that the developer account can *not* be used multiple times in parallel, as doing so will disturb event updates.

For the device things, there is no required configuration (when using discovery). The following parameters exist:

| Config       | Description                                                                      |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| serialNumber | Required: The device's serial number. Filled automatically when using discovery. |

| Channel                         | Type                     | Description                                       | Read Only | Remarks |

Remarks:

- [1] If non applicable (charge time without charger or discharge time without load) the device reports those times as 5999 minutes.
- [2] Possible states: 'ac', 'dc' and 'solar'.
- [3] The range of valid values is 100..600 W. Smaller charge powers do not seem to work.
- [4] Storing those values in the device seems to be buggy, so it's possible (and was seen in the wild) for those counters to not increase monotonically.
- [5] Possible states: 'disabled', 'charging' and 'standby'. 'standby' happens in case of solar and AC charging both being active, AC gets priority in that case.

## PowerStream channels

## Thing Configuration

If you want to create the API bridge in a .things file, the entry has to look as follows:

```java
Bridge ecoflow:ecoflow-api:ecoflowapi [ accessKey="YOUR_ACCESS_KEY", secretKey="YOUR_SECRET_KEY" ]
```

The devices are detected automatically.
If you also want to enter those manually, the syntax is as follows:

```java
Bridge ecoflow:ecoflow-api:ecoflowapi [ accessKey="YOUR_ACCESS_KEY", secretKey="YOUR_SECRET_KEY" ]
{
    Thing delta2-max myPowerStation "EcoFlow power station" [ serialNumber="serial number as printed on device" ]
}
```

## Item Configuration

You can link the channels listed above to items via the UI. If you want to do it via an `.items` file in your `$OPENHAB_CONF/items` folder, the syntax looks like this:

```java
Number Delta2BatteryLevel "Delta 2 Battery Level" { channel="ecoflow:delta2-max:ecoflowapi:myPowerStation:status#battery-level" }
Switch Delta2UsbEnabled   "Delta 2 USB Enabled"    { channel="ecoflow:delta2-max:ecoflowapi:myPowerStation:dc-output#usb-enabled" }
[...]
```
