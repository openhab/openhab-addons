# Daikin Binding

The Daikin binding allows you to control your Daikin air conditioning units with openHAB.

In order to do so, your Daikin air conditioning unit must have a supported Wi-Fi adapter installed.
This may work with the older KRP series of wired adapters, but has not been tested with them.

## Supported Things

| Thing             | Daikin Wi-Fi Adapter Model                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `ac_unit`         | BRP069A81, BRP069B41, BRP072A42, BRP072C42 |
| `airbase_ac_unit` | BRP15B61                                   |

## Discovery

This add-on will broadcast messages on your local network looking for Daikin air conditioning units and adding them to the queue of new items discovered.
You can also manually add a new item if you know the IP address.

Background discovery polls the network every minute for devices.
Background discovery is **enabled** by default.
To **disable** background discovery, add the following line to the _conf/services/runtime.cfg_ file:

```text
discovery.daikin:background=false
```

### BRP072C42 adapter discovery

A BRP072C42 adapter requires a registered UUID to authenticate. Upon discovery, a UUID will be generated but the adapter's key must be entered in the Thing configuration to complete the UUID registration.

## Thing Configuration

- `host` - The hostname of the Daikin air conditioner. Typically you'd use an IP address such as `192.168.0.5` for this field.
- `refresh` - The frequency with which to refresh information from the Daikin air conditioner specified in seconds. Defaults to 60 seconds.

### Additional Thing configurations for BRP072C42 adapter

- `secure` - Must be set to true for BRP072C42 to access it through https.
- `uuid` - A UUID used to access the BRP072C42 adapter. A handy UUID generator can be found at <https://www.uuidgenerator.net/>.
- `key` - The 13-digit key from the Daikin adapter.

## Channels

The temperature channels have a precision of one half degree Celsius.

## Demand Control

Some units have a _demand control_ feature to limit the maximum power usage to a certain percentage.
This is set through the `demandcontrolmode` channel which accepts `OFF`, `MANUAL`, `SCHEDULED`, or `AUTO`.

When changing the mode from `MANUAL` to another mode, the maximum power setting will be saved in the Binding's memory and restored when switching the mode back to `MANUAL`.
Equally, when changing the mode from `SCHEDULED` to another mode, the current schedule will be saved in the Binding's memory and restored when switching the mode back to `SCHEDULED`.

### Manual Demand Control

Manual demand control requires setting the `demandcontrolmaxpower` channel to the desired limit.
The unit accepts values between 40% and 100% in increments of 5.

Sending a command to the `demandcontrolmaxpower` channel will automatically switch the demand control mode to `MANUAL`.

### Scheduled Demand Control

It is possible to set the demand control power limit based on day of the week and time of day schedules.
When the unit is in scheduled demand control mode, the binding provides the current schedule through the `demandcontrolschedule` channel.

In `SCHEDULED`, the `demandcontrolmaxpower` channel will provide the _current_ maximum power in effect, as defined within the schedule.
This information is not provided by the unit itself.
It is calculated by the binding based on the current schedule.
Therefore, it is important to ensure that openHAB's local time is in sync with the unit's date/time.

The schedule and associated max power settings can be set by sending a command to the `demandcontrolschedule` channel.
When doing so, the demand control mode will automatically change to `SCHEDULED`, if it wasn't already in that mode.

The schedule is specified in a JSON string in the following format:

```json
{
  "monday": [
    {
      "enabled": true,
      "time": <minutes from midnight>,
      "power": <power in percent>
    }
  ],
  "tuesday": [
    // Schedule entries for Tuesday
  ],
  "wednesday": [

  ],
  // more days up to Sunday
  "sunday": [

  ]
}
```

Concrete example:

The JSON format doesn't actually support comments. They are provided for clarity.

```json
{
  "monday": [
    {
      "enabled": true,
      "time": 480, // 8 am
      "power": 80
    },
    {
      "enabled": true,
      "time": 600, // 10 am
      "power": 100
    },
    {
      "enabled": true,
      "time": 960, // 4pm
      "power": 50
    }
  ],
  "tuesday": [
    {
      "enabled": true,
      "time": 480, // 8 am
      "power": 80
    },
    {
      "enabled": true,
      "time": 600, // 10 am
      "power": 100
    },
    {
      "enabled": true,
      "time": 960, // 4pm
      "power": 50
    }
  ],
  "wednesday": [
    {
      "enabled": true,
      "time": 480, // 8 am
      "power": 80
    },
    {
      "enabled": true,
      "time": 600, // 10 am
      "power": 100
    },
    {
      "enabled": true,
      "time": 960, // 4pm
      "power": 50
    }
  ],
  "thursday": [
    {
      "enabled": true,
      "time": 480, // 8 am
      "power": 100
    }
  ]
  // omitted days mean that they contain no schedules
}
```

Note:

- Each day can have up to 4 schedule entries
- `enabled` means whether this schedule element is enabled.
- `time` is the start time of the schedule, expressed in number of minutes from midnight.
- `power` a value of zero means demand power is disabled at the time defined by the `time` element.
- When there are no schedules defined for the current day/time, it is believed that the settings from the previous schedule will apply, bearing in mind that it is a weekly recurring schedule.
  This is ultimately determined by the logic in the unit itself, and not controlled by the Binding.
