thing-type.config.remoteopenhab.server.aliveInterval.label = Alive Interval
thing-type.config.remoteopenhab.server.aliveInterval.description = Number of last minutes to consider when monitoring the receipt of events from the remote server. If an event is received during this interval, the remote server is considered alive and its accessibility will not be verified. Use 0 to disable this feature. Default is 5.
thing-type.config.remoteopenhab.server.authenticateAnyway.label = Authenticate Anyway
thing-type.config.remoteopenhab.server.authenticateAnyway.description = Set it to true in case you want to pass authentication information even when the communicate with the remote openHAB server is not secured (only HTTP). This is of course not recommended especially if your connection is over the Internet. Default is false.
thing-type.config.remoteopenhab.server.host.label = Server Address
thing-type.config.remoteopenhab.server.host.description = The host name or IP address of the remote openHAB server.

thing-type.config.remoteopenhab.server.restartIfNoActivity.label = Restart if no Activity
thing-type.config.remoteopenhab.server.restartIfNoActivity.description = Set it to true if you want to restart the connection (SSE) to the remote server when no events are received in the monitored interval. It is not necessary if the goal is to properly handle a short network outage (few seconds). This can be useful if you want to deal with a long network outage. Do not enable it if you remote server does not send events during the monitored interval under normal conditions, it will cause frequent restart of the connection and potential loss of events. Default is false.
thing-type.config.remoteopenhab.server.token.label = Token
thing-type.config.remoteopenhab.server.token.description = The token to use when the remote openHAB server is setup to require authorization to run its REST API.
