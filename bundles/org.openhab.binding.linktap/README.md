# LinkTap Binding

This binding is for [Link-Tap](https://www.link-tap.com/) devices.

**This is for communication over a local area network, that prevents direct access to your gateway / openHAB instance from the internet.
E.g. behind a router**

The method of interaction this binding supports is:

**Program and execution of the watering plan within the application**

The currently supported capabilities include where supported by the gateway / device:

- Time synchronisation to openHAB
- Child lock controls
- Monitoring and dismissal for device alarms (Water Cut, etc.)
- Monitoring of sensor states (Battery, Zigbee Signal, Flow Meters Statistics, etc.)
- Enable watering based on time duration / volume limits
- Shutdown of active watering

## Requirements

A LinkTap gateway device such as the GW_02, in order for openHAB to connect to the system, as a gateway.
Older GW_01 gateway devices have not been tested but should work with a static IP setup.

The recommended minimum version of the firmware is:

- **GW_01** is to start with **at least S609**
- **GW_02** is to start with **at least G609**

## Connection Options

LinkTap supports MQTT and a direct interaction via HTTP.
This binding directly interacts with LinkTap's gateway devices using the Local HTTP API (HTTP).
The binding connects to the gateway's directly, and the Gateway is configured automatically to push updates to openHAB if it has a HTTP configured server.
(Note HTTPS is not supported).

Should the Gateway device's not be able to connect to the binding it automatically falls-back to a polling implementation (15 second cycle).
The gateway supports 1 Local HTTP API, for an ideal behavior the Gateway should be able to connect to openHAB on a HTTP port by its IP, and only a single openHAB instance should be connected to a Gateway.
It is recommended that you use **static IP's** for this binding, **for both openHAB and the Gateway device(s)** regardless of the gateway's model.

If dynamic IPs are used for the gateway, the mDNS address is recommended to be used.
This can be found when running a manual scan, for LinkTap Gateways.
This will remove any DNS caching related issues, depending on your setup.

## Supported Things

This binding supports the follow thing types:

| Thing Type | Thing Type UID | Discovery          | Description                                                      |
|------------|----------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Bridge     | gateway        | Manual / Automatic | A connection to a LinkTap Gateway device                         |
| Thing      | device         | Automatic          | A end device such as one of the four controlled values on the Q1 |

**NOTE** This binding was developed and tested using a GW-02 gateway with a Q1 device.

## Discovery

### Gateways

If mDNS has been enabled on the Gateway device via it's webpage, then the gateway(s) will be discovered, and appear in the inbox when a manual scan is run when adding a LinkTap Gateway.
It is however recommended to use **static IP addresses** and add the gateways directly using the IP address.

### Devices

Once connected to a LinkTap gateway, the binding will listen for updates of new devices and add them, to the inbox.
If the gateway cannot publish to openHAB, then the gateway is checked every 2 minutes for new devices, and they are added to the inbox when discovered.

**NOTE:**
There are 4 different areas of channels:

- R (Read Only Data)
  - These represent data published by the device
- Alerts
  - These are switches that are set to ON by the device when an alert condition is detected, such as a Water Cut.
  - The alert can be dismissed by setting the switch to OFF
- RW (Read Write Data)
  - Provides the ability to read data
  - Provides the ability to set a relevant state to the data
- W Data
  - Provides parameter values for the named action, it is stored within openHAB is not read from the device
    - E.g. Start Immediate Watering
      - Can be limited by a time duration - ohDurLimit
      - If a flow meter is attached can be limited by a volume limit - ohVolLimit

#### Other Models

Please check the [Link-Tap](https://www.link-tap.com/) website.
Presently at this location [here](https://www.link-tap.com/#!/wireless-water-timer) is a chart that shows the features available for the products.
If a product such as the G1S is used, it will not support flow based commands or readings.
In this case exclude the volume based Items and Sitemap entries.

Note in cases such as the G1S where flow meters are not included, or are disconnected, the instant watering will be based solely on the time arguments.
Flow data would as expected not be updated.
