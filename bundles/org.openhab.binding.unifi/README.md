# UniFi Binding

This binding integrates with [Ubiquiti UniFi Networks](https://www.ubnt.com/products/#unifi) allowing for presence detection of network clients.

## Supported Things

- `controller` - An instance of the UniFi controller software
- `site` - A site thing with connection statistics
- `wlan` - A wireless network thing. Control Wi-Fi network and easy access to access.
- `wirelessClient` - Any wireless client connected to a UniFi wireless network
- `wiredClient` - A wired client connected to the UniFi network
- `poePort` - A PoE (Power over Ethernet) port on a UniFi switch

## Discovery

The binding supports discovery of things connected to a UniFi controller (Bridge).
To discover things start the discovery process manually.

## Binding Configuration

The binding has no configuration options, all configuration is done at the Bridge and Thing levels.

## Bridge Configuration

You need at least one UniFi Controller (Bridge) for this binding to work.
It requires a network accessible instance of the [Ubiquiti Networks Controller Software](https://www.ubnt.com/download/unifi).

The following table describes the Bridge configuration parameters:

| Parameter                | Description                                                                 | Config   | Default |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |--------- | ------- |
| host                     | Hostname of IP address of the UniFi Controller                              | Required | -       |
| port                     | Port of the UniFi Controller. For UniFi OS, the default port is usually 443 | Required | -       |
| unifios                  | If the UniFi Controller is running on UniFi OS                              | Required | false   |
| username                 | The username to access the UniFi Controller                                 | Required | -       |
| password                 | The password to access the UniFi Controller                                 | Required | -       |
| refresh                  | Refresh interval in seconds                                                 | Optional | 10      |

## Thing Configuration

You must define a UniFi Controller (Bridge) before defining UniFi Things for this binding to work.

### `site`

The following table describes the `site` configuration parameters:

| Parameter    | Description                                                  | Config   | Default |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------|--------- | ------- |
| sid          | The name, description or id of the site                      | Required | -       |

### `wlan`

The following table describes the `wlan` configuration parameters:

| Parameter    | Description                                                  | Config   | Default |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------|--------- | ------- |
| wid          | The name or id of the WLAN                                   | Required | -       |

### `wirelessClient` & `wiredClient`

The following table describes the `wirelessClient` & `wiredClient` configuration parameters:

| Parameter    | Description                                                  | Config   | Default |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------|--------- | ------- |
| cid          | The MAC address, IP address, hostname or alias of the client | Required | -       |
| site         | The site where the client should be found                    | Optional | -       |
| considerHome | The interval in seconds to consider the client as home       | Optional | 180     |

Here's some additional notes regarding the thing configuration parameters:

#### `cid`

The `cid` parameter is a universal "client identifier". It accepts the following values:

  1. MAC address [highest priority]
  1. IP address
  1. Hostname (as show by the controller)
  1. Alias (as defined by you in the controller UI) [lowest priority]

The priority essentially means the binding attempts to lookup by MAC address, then by IP address, then by hostname and finally by alias.
Once it finds a matching client, it short circuits and stops searching.
Most of the time, you will simply use the  MAC address.

#### `site`

The `site` parameter is optional. If you leave it blank, the client will appear `ONLINE` if found in _any_ site defined on the controller.

You may use the `site` parameter as a filter if you only want the client to appear home if it is found in the site defined in the `site` parameter.

Additionally, you may use friendly site names as they appear in the controller UI.

#### `considerHome`

The `considerHome` parameter allows you to control how quickly the binding marks a client as away.
For example, using the default of `180` (seconds), the binding will report a client away as soon as `lastSeen` + `180` (seconds) < `now`.

### `poePort`

The following table describes the `poePort` configuration parameters:

| Parameter  | Description                                               | Config   |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| portNumber | The port number as reported by the switch (starts with 1) | Required |
| macAddress | The MAC address of the switch device the port is part of  | Required |

#### `blocked`

The `blocked` channel allows you to block / unblock a client via the controller.

#### `reconnect`

The `reconnect` channel allows you to force a client to reconnect.
Sending `ON` to this channel will trigger a reconnect via the controller.

### `poePort`

The `poePort` information that is retrieved is available as these channels:

| Channel ID | Item Type                | Description                                           | Permissions |
|------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| online     | Switch                   | Online status of the port                             | Read        |
| mode       | Selection                | Select the PoE mode: off, auto, pasv24 or passthrough | Read, Write |
| enable     | Switch                   | Enable Power over Ethernet                            | Read, Write |
| cmd        | String                   | Command channel: `power-cycle`: Power Cycle port      | Write       |
| power      | Number:Power             | Power consumption of the port in Watt                 | Read        |
| voltage    | Number:ElectricPotential | Voltage of the port in Volt                           | Read        |
| current    | Number:ElectricCurrent   | Current used by the port in mA                        | Read        |

The `enable` switch channel has a configuration parameter `mode` which is the value used to switch PoE on when the channel is switched to ON.
The default mode value is `auto`.

## Rule Actions

As an alternative to using the `guestVoucher` and `guestVouchersGenerate` channels on the `site` thing, it is possible to use rule actions on the thing to generate, revoke and list guest vouchers.
The following actions are available:

- `boolean success = generateVoucher(Integer expire, Integer users, Integer upLimit, Integer downLimit, Integer dataQuota)`
- `boolean success = generateVouchers(Integer count, Integer expire, Integer users, Integer upLimit, Integer downLimit, Integer dataQuota)`
- `boolean success = revokeVoucher(String voucherCode)`
- `boolean success = revokeVouchers(List<String> voucherCodes)`
- `boolean success = revokeAllVouchers()`
- `String vouchers = listVouchers()`

Since there is a separate rule action instance for each `site` thing, this needs to be retrieved through `getActions(scope, thingUID)`.
The first parameter always has to be `unifi` and the second is the full Thing UID of the site that should be used.
Once this action instance is retrieved, you can invoke the action method on it.

Boolean return values for the actions indicate success or failure.

The `generateVoucher(s)` actions parameters match the configuration parameters for the `guestVouchersGenerate` channel.
With the actions, these parameters can be controlled in a rule or script.
`null` values for the parameters are allowed, and will set the parameter to the default value.

| Parameter     | Description                                                                 | Default |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| count         | Number of vouchers to create                                                |    1    |
| expire        | Minutes a voucher is valid after activation (default is 1 day)              |  1440   |
| users         | Number of users for voucher, 0 for no limit                                 |    1    |
| upLimit       | Upload speed limit in kbps, no limit if not set                             |         |
| downLimit     | Download speed limit in kbps, no limit if not set                           |         |
| dataQuota     | Data transfer quota in MB per user, no limit if not set                     |         |

The `revoke...` actions allow you to revoke previously created vouchers.
The parameter is the voucher code or a list of voucher codes to be revoked.

The `listVouchers` action will return a json string representing the currently available vouchers for the site.
The json contains all parameters for the voucher, therefore it is possible to filter on these in a rule or script.
For example, one could retrieve all vouchers created before a certain time and use the `revokeVouchers` action to delete these.
The structure of the returned json is (depending on content, some fields may be missing):

```json
[
    {
        "code": "3867791284",
        "createTime": "2023-01-31T14:40:47Z",
        "duration": 1440,
        "quota": 2,
        "used": 0,
