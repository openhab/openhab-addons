# DolbyCP Binding

This binding is intended to connect to a _Dolby Digital Cinema Processor CP750_.
Support for CP950 may be added in future (if someone who owns one helps to test it).

It uses ASCII commands send over a TCP connection on port 61408.
Please note that the CP750 only accepts up to 20 simultaneous connection and will discard the oldest connection if a 21st connection is established.
So be sure to grateful shutdown each connection using the client's close() method, or it's AutoCloseable functionality.

This binding wraps the CP750 Java library from https://github.com/Cybso/cp750-java/.

This project is NOT affiliated with, funded, or in any way associated with Dolby Laboratories, Inc.

## Supported Things

- `cp750` - The Dolby Digital Cinema Processor CP750 Device.

## Thing Configuration

Normally, only the hostname or IP address must be configured.

### `cp750` Thing Configuration

| port              | integer | TCP port if different from 61408                             | 61408   | no       | no       |
| refreshInterval   | integer | Interval the device is polled in seconds                     | 5       | no       | no       |

## Properties

| Name              | Description                                              |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| osVersion         | The operating system's version as returned by the device |

## Channels

These channels can be used to retrieve the current device state and change the controls.

The input mode can be either be controlled by the "input" string channel, or by writing an ON value to the dedicated switch channels, which represents the physical buttons on the CP750 device. 

| Channel    | Type   | Read/Write | Description                                                                                                     |
|------------|--------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| fader      | Dimmer | RW         | Fader value (0 to 100)                                                                                          | 
| mute       | Switch | RW         | Mute (ON or OFF)                                                                                                |
| input      | String | RW         | Input channel as string (one of "analog", "dig_1", "dig_2", "dig_3", "dig_4", "non-sync" or "mic")              |
| analog     | Switch | RW         | Is ON if input mode is 'analog'. When an ON command is retrieved, input mode will be changed to this channel.   |
| dig1       | Switch | RW         | Is ON if input mode is 'dig_1'. When an ON command is retrieved, input mode will be changed to this channel.    |
| dig2       | Switch | RW         | Is ON if input mode is 'dig_2'. When an ON command is retrieved, input mode will be changed to this channel.    |
| dig3       | Switch | RW         | Is ON if input mode is 'dig_3'. When an ON command is retrieved, input mode will be changed to this channel.    |
| dig4       | Switch | RW         | Is ON if input mode is 'dig_4'. When an ON command is retrieved, input mode will be changed to this channel.    |
| nonsync    | Switch | RW         | Is ON if input mode is 'non-sync'. When an ON command is retrieved, input mode will be changed to this channel. |
| mic        | Switch | RW         | Is ON if input mode is 'mic'. When an ON command is retrieved, input mode will be changed to this channel.      |
