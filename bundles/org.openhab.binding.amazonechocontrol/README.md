# Amazon Echo Control Binding

This binding can control Amazon Echo devices (Alexa) and Smarthome devices connected through Alexa or a skill.

Upgrade notice:

- The `lastVoiceCommand` channel of the `amazonechocontrol` binding changed its behavior in version 5.0.0.
Due to a wrong implementation the channel changed it's state to an empty string if the same command was received again.
This has been corrected.
If you want to be notified about every state update, please adjust your rule triggers to "received update".
If you want to be notified about state changes (i.e. different commands), use "state changed".
- The write-only channels now use `autoUpdatePolicy=veto` (i.e. they don't update the item's state when a command was send).
- The channels `amazonMusic`, `amazonMusicTrackId`, `amazonPlaylistId`, `radio` and `radioStationId` have been removed because they are no longer supported from Amazon.
You can use the `textCommand` channel with a value of `Play playlist CrazyMusic on AmazonMusic` instead.
- The `lastVoiceCommand` channel will be converted to a read-only channel.
Using commands to that channel is deprecated and will stop working in future versions.
Please use the `textToSpeech` channel instead.

## What this can be used for

It provides features to control and view the current state of echo devices:

- use echo device as text to speech from a rule
- execute a text command
- volume
- pause/continue/next track/previous track
- connect/disconnect bluetooth devices
- start playing tuneIn radio
- start playing Amazon Music
- control of multi room music
- show album art image in sitemap
- speak a reminder message
- plays an alarm sound
- start traffic news
- start daily briefing
- start weather report
- start good morning report
- start automation routine
- activate multiple configurations of flash briefings
- start playing music by providing the voice command as text (Works with all music providers)
- get last spoken voice command
- change the volume of the alarm
- change the equalizer settings
- get information about the next alarm, reminder and timer
- send a message to the echo devices
- control alexa smart thermostat

It also provides features to control devices connected to your echo:

- turn on/off your lights
- change the color
- control groups of lights or just single bulbs
- receive the current state of the lights
- turn on/off smart plugs (e. g. OSRAM)
- receive states of attached sensors like particulate matter or carbon monoxide

Restrictions:

- groups can't receive their current color (multiple colors are possible)
- devices can only receive their state every 60 seconds
- turning on/off (or switch color, change brightness) will send a request for every single bulb in a group

Some ideas what you can do in your home by using rules and other openHAB controlled devices:

- Automatic turn on your amplifier and connect echo with bluetooth if the echo plays music
- If the amplifier was turned off, the echo stop playing and disconnect the bluetooth
- The echo starts playing radio if the light was turned on
- The echo starts playing radio at specified time
- Remind you with a voice message, that a window is open for a long time and it is winter
- Start a routine which welcome you, if you come home
- Start a routine which switch a smart home device connected to Alexa
- Start your briefing if you turn on the light first time in the morning
- Have different flash briefing in the morning and evening
- Let Alexa say 'welcome' to you if you open the door
- Implement own handling for voice commands in a rule
- Change the equalizer settings depending on the bluetooth connection
- Turn on a light on your alexa alarm time
- Activate or deactivate the Alexa Guard with presence detection
- Adjust thermostat setpoint and mode

With the possibility to control your lights you could do:

- a scene-based configuration of your rooms
- connect single bulbs to functions of openHAB
- simulate your presence at home
- automatically turn on your lights at the evening
- integrate your smart bulbs with rules

## First Steps

You must define an `account` (Bridge) before defining any other Thing can be used.

1. Create an Amazon `account` thing
1. Open the url `YOUR_OPENHAB/amazonechocontrol` in your browser (e.g. http://openhab:8080/amazonechocontrol/), click the link for your account thing and login.
1. You should see now a message that the login was successful
1. If you encounter redirect/page refresh issues, enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on your Amazon account.

## Discovery

After configuration of the account thing with the login data, the echo devices registered in the Amazon account, get discovered.
If the device type is not known by the binding, the device will not be discovered.
But you can define any device listed in your Alexa app with the best matching existing device (e.g. echo).
You will find the required serial number in settings of the device in the Alexa app.

### Discover Smart Home Devices

If you want to discover your smart home devices you need to activate it in the 'Amazon Account' thing.
Devices from other skills can be discovered too.
See section *Smart Home Devices* below for more information.

## Advanced Feature Technically Experienced Users

The url <YOUR_OPENHAB>/amazonechocontrol/<YOUR_ACCOUNT>/PROXY/<API_URL> provides a proxy server with an authenticated connection to the Amazon Alexa server.
This can be used to call Alexa API from rules.

E.g. to read out the history call from an installation on openhab:8080 with an account named account1:

http://openhab:8080/amazonechocontrol/account1/PROXY/api/activities?startTime=&size=50&offset=1

### Example

### `flashbriefingprofile` Thing Configuration

The `flashbriefingprofile` has no configuration parameters.
It will be configured at runtime by using the save channel to store the current flash briefing configuration in the thing. Create a `flashbriefingprofile` Thing for each set you need.
E.g. One Flashbriefing profile with technical news and wheater, one for playing world news and one for sport news.

Flash briefings are sets of information that can be configured in your Alexa app.
The app only allows to have one flash-briefing configuration at the same time (e.g. weather and news).
The `flashbriefingprofile` thing helps you to overcome this limitation.

To set it up using managed (UI) configuration:

1. Use the app to create the flash-briefing configuration you want.
2. Start the discovery, you should see a new "flashbriefingprofile" thing. If this is not the case, a thing with the current configuration already exists.
3. Add that thing (you can use a custom name if you want).
4. Repeat steps 1-3 for other configurations (you can add as many as you want, make sure they are different).

Textual configuration (untested, not recommended):

1. Add a new `flashbriefiungprofilething` to your `.things` file.
2. Use the app to create the flash-briefing configuration you want.
3. Send `ON` to the `save` channel of the thing you created in step 1.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 for other configurations (you can add as many as you want, make sure they are different).

#### Channels

| Channel Type ID | Item Type | Access Mode | Description                                                                                                                                   |
|-----------------|-----------|:-----------:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `save`          | Switch    |      W      | Write Only! Stores the current configuration of flash briefings.                                                                              |
| `active`        | Switch    |     R/W     | Activates this flash briefing as default ON ALL DEVICES.                                                                                      |
| `playOnDevice`  | String    |      W      | Specify the echo serial number or name to start the flash-briefing. This is only exceuted once and the default configuration does not change. |

**Attention:** Be careful when using the `save` channel.
Storing the same configuration to several things may result in unpredictable behavior.

### Example

#### flashbriefings.things

```java
Bridge amazonechocontrol:account:account1 "Amazon Account" @ "Accounts" [discoverSmartHome=2]
{
    Thing flashbriefingprofile flashbriefing1 "Flash Briefing Technical" @ "Flash Briefings"
    Thing flashbriefingprofile flashbriefing2 "Flash Briefing Life Style" @ "Flash Briefings"
}
```

#### flashbriefings.items

```java
// Flashbriefings
Switch FlashBriefing_Technical_Save   "Save (Write only)" { channel="amazonechocontrol:flashbriefingprofile:account1:flashbriefing1:save"}
Switch FlashBriefing_Technical_Active "Active" { channel="amazonechocontrol:flashbriefingprofile:account1:flashbriefing1:active"}

String FlashBriefing_LifeStyle_Play   "Play (Write only)" { channel="amazonechocontrol:flashbriefingprofile:account1:flashbriefing2:playOnDevice"}
```

#### flashbriefings.sitemap

```java
sitemap flashbriefings label="Flash Briefings"
{
        Frame label="Flash Briefing Technical" {
            Switch  item=FlashBriefing_Technical_Save
            Switch  item=FlashBriefing_Technical_Active
            Text    item=FlashBriefing_Technical_Play
        }

        Frame label="Flash Briefing Life Style" {
            Switch  item=FlashBriefing_LifeStyle_Save
            Switch  item=FlashBriefing_LifeStyle_Active
            Text    item=FlashBriefing_LifeStyle_Play
        }
}
```

### `smartHomeDevice` and `smartHomeDeviceGroup` Thing Configuration

| Configuration name       | Description                                                               |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| id                       | The id of the device or device group                                      |

The only possibility to find out the id is using discovery function in the UI.
You can use that id if you want to define the thing in a file.

1. Open the url YOUR_OPENHAB/amazonechocontrol in your browser (e.g. `http://openhab:8080/amazonechocontrol/`)
1. Click on the name of the account thing
1. Click on the name of the echo thing
1. Scroll to the channel and copy the required ID

Discovered smart home devices show a `deviceIdentifierList` in their thing properties, containing one or more serial numbers.
You can check if any of these serial numbers is associated with another device and use this to identify devices with similar/same names.

### Channels

The channels of the smarthome devices will be generated at runtime.
Check in the UI thing configurations, which channels are created.

| Channel ID               | Item Type            | Access Mode | Thing Type                            | Description                                                                                                                 |

*Note* the channels of `smartHomeDevices` and `smartHomeDeviceGroup` will be created dynamically based on the capabilities reported by the Amazon server. This can take a little bit of time.
The polling interval configured in the Account Thing to get the state is specified in minutes and has a minimum of 10. This means it takes up to 10 minutes to see the state of a channel. The reason for this low interval is, that the polling causes a big server load for the Smart Home Skills.

*Note*: The `color` channel is read-only by default because Alexa does only support setting colors by their name.
It has a configuration parameter `matchColors` which enables writing to that channel and tries to find the closes available color when sending a command to Alexa.

### Example

#### smarthome.things

```java
Bridge amazonechocontrol:account:account1 "Amazon Account" @ "Accounts" [discoverSmartHome=2, pollingIntervalSmartHomeAlexa=30, pollingIntervalSmartSkills=120]
{
    Thing smartHomeDevice      smartHomeDevice1 "Smart Home Device 1" @ "Living Room" [id="ID"]
    Thing smartHomeDevice      smartHomeDevice2 "Smart Home Device 2" @ "Living Room" [id="ID"]
    Thing smartHomeDevice      smartHomeDevice3 "Smart Home Device 3" @ "Living Room" [id="ID"]
    Thing smartHomeDeviceGroup smartHomeDeviceGroup1 "Living Room Group" @   "Living Room" [id="ID"]
}
```

#### smarthome.items

Sample for the Thing echo1 only. But it will work in the same way for the other things, only replace the thing name in the channel link.
Take a look in the channel description above to know which channels are supported by your thing type.

```java
// Lights and lightgroups
Switch Light_State "On/Off"            { channel="amazonechocontrol:smartHomeDevice:account1:smartHomeDevice1:powerState" }
Dimmer Light_Brightness "Brightness"   { channel="amazonechocontrol:smartHomeDevice:account1:smartHomeDevice1:brightness" }
Color  Light_Color "Color"             { channel="amazonechocontrol:smartHomeDevice:account1:smartHomeDevice1:color" }
String Light_Color_Name "Color Name"   { channel="amazonechocontrol:smartHomeDevice:account1:smartHomeDevice1:colorName" }
String Light_White "White temperature" { channel="amazonechocontrol:smartHomeDevice:account1:smartHomeDevice1:colorTemperatureName" }

// Smart plugs
Switch Plug_State "On/Off"             { channel="amazonechocontrol:smartHomeDevice:account1:smartHomeDevice2:powerState" }

// Alexa Guard
Switch Arm_State "State"               { channel="amazonechocontrol:smartHomeDevice:account1:smartHomeDevice3:armState" }

// Smart Home device group
Switch Group_State "On/Off"            { channel="amazonechocontrol:smartHomeDeviceGroup:account1:smartHomeDeviceGroup1:powerState" }
```

The only possibility to find out the id for the smartHomeDevice and smartHomeDeviceGroup Things is by using the discover function.

#### smarthome.sitemap

```java
sitemap smarthome label="Smart Home Devices"
{
        Frame label="Lights and light groups" {
            Switch item=Light_State
            Slider item=Light_Brightness
            Default item=Light_Color
            Selection item=Light_Color_Name mappings=[ ''='', 'red'='Red', 'crimson'='Crimson', 'salmon'='Salmon', 'orange'='Orange', 'gold'='Gold', 'yellow'='Yellow', 'green'='Green', 'turquoise'='Turquoise', 'cyan'='Cyan', 'sky_blue'='Sky Blue', 'blue'='Blue', 'purple'='Purple', 'magenta'='Magenta', 'pink'='Pink', 'lavender'='Lavender' ]

            Selection item=Arm_State mappings=[ 'ARMED_AWAY'='Active', 'ARMED_STAY'='Present', 'ARMED_NIGHT'='Night', 'DISARMED'='Deactivated' ]
        }
}
```

#### Rule for calculating the distance of a Tile from your home

Link the `geoLocation` channel of the Tile thing to a `Location` item named `CarLocation`.
Add a second item of type `Number:Length` with the name `CarDistance` (adjust state description to your needs, e.g. miles or km as unit).
Create a rule that triggers on change of that item with the DSL script as action:

```
var homeLocation = new PointType("50.273448, 8.409950")
CarDistance.postUpdate(homeLocation.distanceFrom(CarLocation.state as PointType).toString + " m")
```

## Advanced Feature Technically Experienced Users

The url <YOUR_OPENHAB>/amazonechocontrol/<YOUR_ACCOUNT>/PROXY/<API_URL> provides a proxy server with an authenticated connection to the Amazon Alexa server.
This can be used to call Alexa API from rules.

E.g. to read out the history call from an installation on openhab:8080 with an account named account1:

http://openhab:8080/amazonechocontrol/account1/PROXY/api/activities?startTime=&size=50&offset=1

To resolve login problems the connection settings of an `account` thing can be reset via the karaf console.
The command `amazonechocontrol listAccounts` shows a list of all available `account` things.
The command `amazonechocontrol resetAccount <id>` resets the device id and all other connection settings.
After resetting a connection, a new login as described above is necessary.

## Tutorials

### Let Alexa speak a text from a rule

1) Create a rule with a trigger of your choice

```java
rule "Say welcome if the door opens"
when
    Item Door_Contact changed to OPEN
then
    Echo_Living_Room_TTS.sendCommand('Hello World')
end
```

You can also use [SSML](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/supported-ssml.html) to provide a better voice experience

```java
rule "Say welcome if the door opens"
when
    Item Door_Contact changed to OPEN
then
    Echo_Living_Room_TTS.sendCommand('<speak>I want to tell you a secret.<amazon:effect name="whispered">I am not a real human.</amazon:effect>.Can you believe it?</speak>')
end
```

### Show an announcement on the echo show or echo spot

1) Create a rule with a trigger of your choice

Simple:

```java
rule "Say welcome if the door opens"
when
    Item Door_Contact changed to OPEN
then
    Echo_Living_Room_Announcement.sendCommand('Door opened')
end
```

Expert:

You can use a json formatted string to control title, sound and volume:

```json
{ "sound": true, "speak":"<Speak>", "title": "<Title>", "body": "<Body Text>", "volume": 20}
```

The combination of `sound=true` and `speak` in SSML syntax is not allowed.
Not all properties need to be specified.
The value for `volume` can be between 0 and 100 to set the volume.
A volume value smaller then 0 means that the current alexa volume should be used.
No specification uses the volume from the `textToSpeechVolume` channel.

Note: If you turn off the sound and Alexa is playing music, it will anyway turn down the volume for a moment. This behavior can not be changed.


```java
rule "Say welcome if the door opens"
when
    Item Door_Contact changed to OPEN
then
    Echo_Living_Room_Announcement.sendCommand('{ "sound": false, "title": "Doorstep", "body": "Door opened"}')
end
```

## Playing an alarm sound for 15 seconds with an openHAB rule if a door contact was opened

1) Do get the ID of your sound, follow the steps in "How To Get IDs"
2) Write down the text in the square brackets. e.g. ECHO:system_alerts_repetitive01 for the nightstand sound
3) Create a rule for start playing the sound:

```java
var Timer stopAlarmTimer = null

rule "Turn on alarm sound for 15 seconds if door opens"
when

## Note

This binding uses the same API as the Web-Browser-Based Alexa site (alexa.amazon.de).
In other words, it simulates a user which is using the web page.
Unfortunately, this binding can break if Amazon changes the web site.

The binding is tested with amazon.de, amazon.fr, amazon.it, amazon.com and amazon.co.uk accounts, but should also work with all others.
