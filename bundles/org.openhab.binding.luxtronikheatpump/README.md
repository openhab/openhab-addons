# LuxtronikHeatpump Binding

This binding gives the possibility to integrate any Heatpump that is based on the Luxtronik 2 contol unit of Alpha Innotec. This includes heatpumps of:

- Alpha InnoTec
- Buderus (Logamatic HMC20, HMC20 Z)
- CTA All-In-One (Aeroplus)
- Elco
- Nibe (AP-AW10)
- Roth (ThermoAuraÂ®, ThermoTerra)
- (Siemens) Novelan (WPR NET)
- Wolf Heiztechnik (BWL/BWS)

This binding was tested with:

- Siemens Novelan LD 7

:::tip Note
If you have another heatpump the binding works with, let us know, so we can extend the list
:::

Note: The whole functionality is based on data that was reverse engineered, so use it at your own risk.

## Supported Things

This binding only supports one thing type "Luxtronik Heatpump" (heatpump).

## Discovery

This binding will try to detect heat pumps that are reachable in the same IPv4 subnet.

## Thing Configuration

Each heatpump requires the following configuration parameters:

| parameter       | required | default | description                                                                                                                                            |
|-----------------|----------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ipAddress       | yes      |         | IP address of the heatpump                                                                                                                             |
| port            | no       | 8889    | Port number to connect to. This should be `8889` for most heatpumps. For heatpumps using a firmware version before V1.73 port `8888` needs to be used. |
| refresh         | no       | 300     | Interval (in seconds) to refresh the channel values.                                                                                                   |
| showAllChannels | no       | false   | Show all channels (even those determined as not supported)                                                                                             |

## Channels

As the Luxtronik 2 control is able to handle multiple heat pumps with different features (like heating, hot water, cooling, solar, photovoltaics, swimming pool,...), the binding has a lot channels.
Depending on the heatpump it is used with, various channels might not hold any (useful) values.
If `showAllChannels` is not activated for the thing, this binding will automatically try to hide channels that are not available for your heat pump. As this is done using reverse engineered parameters it might not be correct in all cases.
If you miss a channel that should be available for your heat pump, you can enable `showAllChannels` for your thing, so all channels become available. Feel free to report such a case on the forum, so we can try to improve / fix that behavior.

The following channels are holding read only values:

| channel                               | type                      | advanced | description                                                    |

## Example

Below you can find some example textual configuration for a heatpump with some basic functionallity. This can be extended/adjusted according to your needs and depending on the availability of channels (see list above).

## Development Notes

This binding was initially based on the [Novelan/Luxtronik Heat Pump Binding](https://v2.openhab.org/addons/bindings/novelanheatpump1/) for openHAB 1.

Luxtronik control units have an internal webserver which serves a Java applet. This applet can be used to configure some parts of the heat pump. The applet itselves uses a socket connection to fetch and send data to the heatpump.
This socket is also used by this binding. To get some more information on how this socket works you can check out other Luxtronik tools like [Luxtronik2 for NodeJS](https://github.com/coolchip/luxtronik2).

A detailed parameter description for the Java Webinterface can be found in the [Loxwiki](https://loxwiki.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/LOX/pages/1533935933/Java+Webinterface)
