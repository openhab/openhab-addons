/**
 * Ideally, Insteon ALL LINK messages are received in this order, and
 * only a single one of each:
 *
 * BCAST (a broadcast message from the device to all group members)
 * CLEAN (a cleanup point-to-point message to ensure more reliable transmission)
 * SUCCESS (a broadcast report of success or failure of cleanup, with cmd1=0x06)
 *
 * But often, the BCAST, CLEAN and SUCCESS messages are retransmitted multiple times,
 * or (less frequently) messages are lost. The present state machine was developed
 * to remove duplicates, yet make sure that a single lost message does not cause
 * the binding to miss an update.

 *
 * How to read this diagram:
 *
 * Regular, expected, non-duplicate messages do not have any quotes around them,
 * and lead to the obvious state transitions.
 *
 * The actions in [square brackets] are transitions that cause a state
 * update to be published when they occur.
 *
 * The presence of double quotes indicates a duplicate that does not lead
 * to any state transitions, i.e. it is simply ignored.
 *
 * Single quotes indicate a message that is the result of a single dropped
 * message, and leads to a state transition, in some cases even to a state
 * update to be published.
 *
 * For instance at the top of the diagram, if a "SUCCESS" message is received
 * when in state EXPECT_BCAST, it is considered a duplicate (it has "").
 *
 * When in state EXPECT_SUCCESS though, receiving a ['BCAST'] is most likely because
 * the SUCCESS message was missed, and therefore it is considered the result
 * of a single lost message (has '' around it). The state changes to EXPECT_CLEAN,
 * and the message should lead to publishing of a state update (it has [] around it).
