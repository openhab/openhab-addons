# Nibe Heatpump Binding

The Nibe Heatpump binding is used to get live data from Nibe heat pumps without using an expensive MODBUS40 adapter.
This binding is compatible with the F750, F1145, F1245, F1155, F1255, F470 and SMO40 heat pump models.

The binding supports data telegrams (containing a maximum of 20 registers) from the heat pump.
The binding can also read other registers from the pump.
It is recommended to add the most often updated variables to a telegram.
The binding will then read all other registers automatically from the pump when channels are linked to an item.
Register reading needs to be enabled in the thing configuration.
The binding also has experimental support for writing registers.
This can be used to configure the heat pump.
Write mode needs to be enabled in the thing configuration and for safety reasons all register identifiers need to be explicitly defined.

## Supported Things

This binding supports direct serial port connection (RS-485 adapter needed) to heat pump but also UDP connection via NibeGW software.

## Discovery

Discovery is not supported.

## Prerequisites

When Modbus adapter support is enabled from the heat pump UI, the heat pump will start to send telegrams every now and then.
A telegram contains a maximum of 20 registers.
Those 20 registers can be configured via the Nibe ModbusManager application.

Unfortunately Nibe has made this tricky.
A telegram from the heat pump must be acknowledged, otherwise the heat pump will raise an alarm and go into the alarm state.
Acknowledgement (ACK or NAK) responses should be sent correctly.
The binding also supports direct serial port connections to the heat pump, but the heat pump will raise an alarm when the openHAB binding is not running e.g. during openHAB updates.
This problem can be resolved by using the `nibegw` program, which can be run on Unix/Linux (such as a Raspberry Pi) or Arduino-based boards.
If you are running openHAB on a Raspberry Pi, the `nibegw` program can also run on the same machine.
Then when openHAB is not running , `nibegw` will acknowledge packets from the heat pump.
Obviously, this doesn't solve the problem when the Raspberry Pi is down, therefore an Arduino based solution is recommended.

`nibegw` is an application that reads telegrams from a serial port (which requires an RS-485 adapter), sends ACK/NAK to the heat pump and relays untouched telegrams to openHAB via UDP packets.
The Nibe Heat Pump binding will listen to a UDP port and parse register data from UDP telegrams.

### Arduino

An Arduino-based solution has been tested with Arduino uno + RS485 and Ethernet shields.
[PRODINo ESP32 Ethernet v1](https://kmpelectronics.eu/products/prodino-esp32-ethernet-v1/) and [ProDiNo Ethernet V2](https://kmpelectronics.eu/products/prodino-ethernet-v2/) boards are also supported.
PRODINo boards have built-in Ethernet and RS-485 ports.

Arduino code is available [here](https://github.com/openhab/openhab-addons/tree/main/bundles/org.openhab.binding.nibeheatpump/contrib/NibeGW/Arduino/NibeGW).

Arduino code can be build via Arduino IDE.
For more details see [www.arduino.cc](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).
NibeGW configuration (such IP addresses, ports, etc) can be adapted directly by editing the code files.
PRODINo ESP32 Ethernet v1 also supports dynamic configuration and OTA updates via Wi-Fi access point.

### Raspberry Pi (or other Linux/Unix based boards)

C code is available [here](https://github.com/openhab/openhab-addons/tree/main/bundles/org.openhab.binding.nibeheatpump/contrib/NibeGW/RasPi).

To build the C code use:

```shell
gcc -std=gnu99 -o nibegw nibegw.c
```

For getting all command options execute the command using the help switch:

```shell
nibegw -h

./nibegw usage:

    -h                 Print help
    -v                 Print debug information
    -d <device name>   Serial port device (default: /dev/ttyS0)
    -a <address>       Remote host address (default: 127.0.0.1)
    -p <port>          Remote UDP port (default: 9999)
    -f                 Disable flow control (default: HW)
    -r <address>       RS-485 address to listen (default: 0x20)
    -i                 Send all messages by UDP (default: only modbus data)
    -n                 Don't send acknowledge at all
    -o                 Send acknowledge to all addresses
    -t                 Test mode
    -l <port>          Local UDP port for read commands (default: 9999)
    -w <port>          Local UDP port for write commands (default: 10000)
    -q                 Print data in log format

```

Usage example:

```shell
nibegw -v -d /dev/ttyUSB0 -a 192.168.1.10
```

## Binding Configuration

No binding configuration required.

## Thing Configuration
