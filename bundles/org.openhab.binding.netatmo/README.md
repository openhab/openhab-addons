## Binding Configuration

The binding requires you to register an Application with Netatmo Connect at [https://dev.netatmo.com/](https://dev.netatmo.com/) - this will get you a set of Client ID and Client Secret parameters to be used by your configuration.

### Create Netatmo Application

Follow instructions under:

 1. Setting Up Your Account
 1. Registering Your Application
 1. Setting Redirect URI and webhook URI can be skipped, these will be provided by the binding.

Variables needed for the setup of the binding are:

- `<CLIENT_ID>` Your client ID taken from your App at <https://dev.netatmo.com/apps>
- `<CLIENT_SECRET>` A token provided along with the `<CLIENT_ID>`.

The binding has the following configuration options:

| Parameter   | Type    | Description                                                  |
| ----------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| readFriends | Boolean | Enables or disables the discovery of guest weather stations. |

## Netatmo Account (Bridge) Configuration

You will have to create at first a bridge to handle communication with your Netatmo Application.

The Account bridge has the following configuration elements:

| Parameter         | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                            |
| ----------------- | ------ | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| clientId          | String | Yes      | Client ID provided for the application you created on <http://dev.netatmo.com/createapp>                               |
| clientSecret      | String | Yes      | Client Secret provided for the application you created                                                                 |
| webHookUrl        | String | No       | Protocol, public IP and port to access openHAB server from Internet                                                    |
| webHookPostfix    | String | No       | String appended to the generated webhook address (should start with "/")                                               |
| reconnectInterval | Number | No       | The reconnection interval to Netatmo API (in s)                                                                        |

**Supported channels for the Account bridge thing:**

| Channel Group | Channel Id    | Item Type | Description                                                        |
| ------------- | ------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| monitoring    | request-count | Number    | Number of requests transmitted to Netatmo API during the last hour |

### Configure the Bridge

1. Complete the Netatmo Application Registration if you have not already done so, see above.
1. Make sure you have your _Client ID_ and _Client Secret_ identities available.
1. Add a new **"Netatmo Account"** thing. Choose new Id for the account, unless you like the generated one, put in the _Client ID_ and _Client Secret_ from the Netatmo Connect Application registration in their respective fields of the bridge configuration. Save the bridge.
1. The bridge thing will go _OFFLINE_ / _CONFIGURATION_ERROR_ - this is fine. You have to authorize this bridge with Netatmo Connect.
1. Go to the authorization page of your server. `http://<your openHAB address>:8080/netatmo/connect/<_CLIENT_ID_>`. Your newly added bridge should be listed there (no need for you to expose your openHAB server outside your local network for this).
1. Press the _"Authorize Thing"_ button. This will take you either to the login page of Netatmo Connect or directly to the authorization screen. Login and/or authorize the application. You will be returned and the entry should go green.
1. The bridge will go _ONLINE_.

Now that you have got your bridge _ONLINE_ you can now start a scan with the binding to auto discover your things.

Starting on 2023/04/17 - Netatmo API requires an update of the refreshToken provided by the oAuth mechanism every three hours.
Once authentication process has been done, current refreshToken is stored in `/OPENHAB_USERDATA/netatmo` folder.

### Webhook

Netatmo servers can send push notifications to the Netatmo Binding by using a callback URL.
The webhook URL is setup at Netatmo Account level using "Webhook Address" parameter.
You will define here public way to access your openHAB server:

```
http(s)://xx.yy.zz.ww:443
```

Your Netatmo App will be configured automatically by the bridge to the endpoint:

```
http(s)://xx.yy.zz.ww:443/netatmo/webhook/<_CLIENT_ID_><webHookPostfix>
```

Please be aware of Netatmo own limits regarding webhook usage that lead to a 24h ban-time when webhook does not answer 5 times.

NB: Allowed ports for webhooks are 80, 88, 443 and 9443.

### Configure Things

The easiest way to retrieve the IDs for all the devices and modules is to use the console command `openhab:netatmo showIds`.
It shows the hierarchy of all the devices and modules including their IDs.
This can help to define all your things in a configuration file.

**Another way to get the IDs is to use the developer documentation on the netatmo site:**

The IDs for the modules can be extracted from the developer documentation on the netatmo site.
First login with your user.
Then some examples of the documentation contain the **real results** of your weather station.
In order to try the examples, you need the `device_id` of your Netatmo station.
You can find it in the configuration menu of the app (android or apple).
Get the IDs of your devices (indoor, outdoor, rain gauge)
[here](https://dev.netatmo.com/resources/technical/reference/weather/getstationsdata).

`main_device` is the ID of the "main device", the indoor sensor.
This is equal to the MAC address of the Netatmo.

The other modules you can recognize by "module_name" and then note the "\_id" which you need later.

**Another way to get the IDs is to calculate them:**

You have to calculate the ID for the outside module as follows: (it cannot be read from the app)

- if the first serial character is "h": start with "02"
- if the first serial character is "i": start with "03"
- if the first serial character is "j": start with "04"
- if the first serial character is "k": start with "05"

append ":00:00:",

split the rest into three parts of two characters and append with a colon as delimiter.

For example your serial number "h00bcdc" should end up as "02:00:00:00:bc:dc".

## Discovery

If you did not manually create things in the *.things file, the Netatmo Binding is able to discover automatically all depending modules and devices.

## Channels

### Weather Station Main Indoor Device

Weather station uses a default `refreshInterval` of 10 minutes (can be adjusted), based on a standard update period of Netatmo systems.
It will auto-adapt to stick as closely as possible to the last data availability.

### Home

A Home is the Thing holding various modules and devices. They can hold two areas of equipments : Security and Energy.
Depending on the way it is configured the behaviour will be adapted and available channels can vary.

**Home Configuration**

The Home thing has the following configuration elements:

| Parameter       | Type    | Required | Description                                                                         |
| --------------- | ------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| id (1)          | String  | No       | If you have a single type of equipment, this id is to be used for the home          |
| energyId        | String  | No       | Id of a home holding energy control devices                                         |
| securityId      | String  | No       | Id of a home holding security monitoring devices                                    |
| refreshInterval | Integer | No       | Refresh interval for refreshing the data in seconds. Default 180.                   |

At least one of these parameter must be filled - at most two : 

* id or securityId
* id or energyId
* securityId and energyId

(1) this parameter is kept for backward compatibility.

All channels are read only.

### Welcome, Presence and Doorbell Cameras

Warnings:

- The URL of the live snapshot is a fixed URL so the value of the channel cameraLivePictureUrl / welcomeCameraLivePictureUrl will never be updated once first set by the binding. So to get a refreshed picture, you need to use the refresh parameter in your sitemap image element.
- Some features like the video monitoring are accessed via the local network, so it may be helpful to set a static IP address for the camera within your local network.

(*) This channel is configurable : low, poor, high.
(**) This channel handles the REFRESH command for on demand update.

**Supported channels for the Presence Camera thing:**

Warnings:

- The floodlight auto-mode (auto-mode) isn't updated it is changed by another application. Therefore the binding handles its own state of the auto-mode. This has the advantage that the user can define its own floodlight switch off behaviour.

## Example Rules

```java
rule "Notification on home web hook event"
when
Channel "netatmo:home:mybridgeid:myclientid:home-event" triggered
then
logInfo("camera", "Received web hook on home level")
end
```

```java
rule "Notification on camera web hook event"
when
Channel "netatmo:presence:mybridgeid:myclientid:mythingid:home-event" triggered
then
logInfo("camera", "Received web hook on camera level")
end
```

## Rule Actions

Multiple actions are supported by this binding. In classic rules these are accessible as shown in this example (adjust getActions with your ThingId):

Example

```java
 val actions = getActions("netatmo","netatmo:room:myaccount:myhome:livingroom")
 if(null === actions) {
        logInfo("actions", "Actions not found, check thing ID")
        return
 }
```
