# Buienradar Binding

The Buienradar Binding periodically (5 minute intervals) retrieves rainfall predictions from the Dutch [buienradar.nl webservice API.](https://www.buienradar.nl/overbuienradar/gratis-weerdata).

Using the binding, we can

- warn of upcoming rainfall when there are open windows or doors
- prevent watering the outside plants needlessly,
- warn when we are about to leave the house.

## Supported Things

The binding supports one thing, which can be added manually via the web interface. The thing needs longitude and latitude of the location which needs forecasts.

## Discovery

No auto-discovery is currently possible.

## Configuration of the thing

The configuration can be done by adding a Rain Forecast Thing using the UI, or by adding it to a `.things` file:

```java
Thing buienradar:rain_forecast:home [ location="52.198864211111925,5.4192629660193585" ]
```

and adding the relevant items as such in your `.items` file. Please note that the buienradar service only provides predictions in 5 minutes intervals with a maximum of two hours (120 minutes):

```java

## Example data visualisation

In this example we use the 'Discrete' plugin of Grafana to visualize the predictions. Mappings are made according to precipitation intensity (light, medium, heavy) and those categories are given appropriate colors.

![Z-Way Binding](doc/img/grafana-dashboard.png)

The mappings are as follows:

- 0 – 0.01: None (rgba(204, 204, 204, 0))
- 0.01 – 1: Very light (#badff4)
- 1 – 5: Light (#6ed0e0)
- 5 – 20: Medium (#1f78c1)
- 20 – 50: Heavy (#ef843c)
- 50 – 80: Very heavy (#e24d42)
- 80 – 100: Extremely heavy (#890f02)
