# add-on config

automation.config.jsscripting.dependencyTrackingEnabled.label = Enable Dependency Tracking
automation.config.jsscripting.dependencyTrackingEnabled.description = Dependency tracking allows your scripts to automatically reload when one of its dependencies is updated. You may want to disable dependency tracking if you plan on editing or updating a shared library, but don't want all your scripts to reload until you can test it. Please note that changing this setting only applies to scripts loaded after the change.
automation.config.jsscripting.eventConversionEnabled.label = Convert Event from Java to JavaScript type in UI-based scripts
automation.config.jsscripting.eventConversionEnabled.description = Converting the event data from Java to JavaScript types in UI-based scripts allows working with event data in a native JS way without special handling for Java types.<br> With this option enabled, the event data available in UI-based scripts is all JS types and the same as in file-based scripts.<br> Please note that this option <strong>requires both auto-injection & wrapper enabled</strong> and only applies to UI-based scripts and does not affect file-based scripts.
automation.config.jsscripting.group.environment.label = JavaScript Environment

automation.config.jsscripting.injectionCachingEnabled.label = Cache openHAB JavaScript Library Injection
automation.config.jsscripting.injectionCachingEnabled.description = Cache the openHAB JavaScript library injection for optimal performance.<br> Disable this option to allow loading the library from the local user configuration directory "automation/js/node_modules".

automation.config.jsscripting.injectionEnabledV2.description = Import all variables from the openHAB JavaScript library for common services like items, things, actions, log, etc... <br> If disabled, the openHAB JavaScript library can be imported manually using <code>require('openhab')</code>.

automation.config.jsscripting.wrapperEnabled.label = Wrap UI-based scripts in Self-Executing Function
automation.config.jsscripting.wrapperEnabled.description = Wrapping UI-based scripts in a self-executing function allows the use of the <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> variable declarations, as well as the use of <code>function</code> and <code>class</code> declarations.<br> With this option enabled, you can also use <code>return</code> statements in your scripts to abort execution at any point.
