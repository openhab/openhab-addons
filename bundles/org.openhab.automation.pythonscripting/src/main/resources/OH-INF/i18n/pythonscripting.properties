# add-on

addon.pythonscripting.name = Python Scripting
addon.pythonscripting.description = This adds a Python 3.x script engine.

# add-on config

automation.config.pythonscripting.cachingEnabled.label = Cache compiled openHAB Python modules (.pyc files)
automation.config.pythonscripting.cachingEnabled.description = Cache the openHAB python modules for improved startup performance.<br> Disabling this option will result in slower startup performance, because scripts have to be recompiled on every startup.
automation.config.pythonscripting.dependencyTrackingEnabled.label = Enable dependency tracking
automation.config.pythonscripting.dependencyTrackingEnabled.description = Dependency tracking allows your scripts to automatically reload when one of its dependencies is updated. You may want to disable dependency tracking if you plan on editing or updating a shared library, but don't want all your scripts to reload until you can test it.
automation.config.pythonscripting.group.environment.label = Python Environment
automation.config.pythonscripting.group.environment.description = This group defines Python's environment.
automation.config.pythonscripting.group.system.label = System Behavior
automation.config.pythonscripting.group.system.description = This group defines Python's system behavior.
automation.config.pythonscripting.injectionEnabled.label = Activate openHAB Python helper module and inject scope and helper objects into rules.
automation.config.pythonscripting.injectionEnabled.description = Install openHAB Python helper module to support helper classes like rule, logger, Registry, Timer, etc. and automatically injects `from openhab import rule, Registry, logger` into you Python code.<br> If auto injection is disabled, the helper module can still be used by importing it manually.<br> When completely disabled, you get a "pure" Graalpy context that has only been initialized with the default JSR223 presets. The openHAB Python helper module cannot be imported manually in this case.
automation.config.pythonscripting.injectionEnabled.option.4 = Auto injection everywhere, including script files and transformations
automation.config.pythonscripting.injectionEnabled.option.3 = Auto injection for Script Actions, Script Conditions and transformations
automation.config.pythonscripting.injectionEnabled.option.2 = Auto injection only for Script Actions & Script Conditions (recommended)
automation.config.pythonscripting.injectionEnabled.option.1 = Disable auto-injection and import manually instead
automation.config.pythonscripting.injectionEnabled.option.0 = Disable completely
automation.config.pythonscripting.jythonEmulation.label = Enable Jython emulation
automation.config.pythonscripting.jythonEmulation.description = This enables Jython emulation in GraalPy. It is strongly recommended to update code to GraalPy and Python 3 as the emulation can have performance degradation. For tips and instructions, please refer to <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/python/Modern-Python-on-JVM">Jython Migration Guide</a>.
automation.config.pythonscripting.pipModules.label = Python pip modules (requires a manually configured venv)
automation.config.pythonscripting.pipModules.description = A comma separated list of Python modules to install. Versions may be constrained by separating with an <code>==</code> followed by standard python pip version constraint, such as "<code>tzdata==2025.2</code>".
