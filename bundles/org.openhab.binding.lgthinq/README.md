# LG ThinQ Binding

This binding was developed to integrate the LG ThinQ API with openHAB. 

## Supported Things

This binding support several devices from the LG ThinQ Devices V1 & V2 line. 
All devices require a configured Bridge.
See the table bellow:

| Thing ID            | Device Name     | Versions | Special Functions            | Commands                                        | Obs                                                                                                                                                              |

## `bridge` Thing

This binding has a Bridge responsible for discovering and registering LG Things. 
Thus, adding the Bridge (LGThinq GW Bridge) is the first step in configuring this Binding.
The following parameters are available to configure the Bridge and to link to your LG Account as well:

## Discovery

This Binding has auto-discovery for the supported LG Thinq devices. 
Once LG Thinq Bridge has been added, LG Thinq devices linked to your account will be automatically discovered and displayed in the openHAB Inbox. 

## Thing Configuration

All the configurations are pre-defined by the discovery process.
But you can customize to fine-tune the device's state polling process.
See the table below:

| Parameter                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                | Default Value | Supported Devices             |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-------------------------------|
| pollingPeriodPowerOffSeconds  | Seconds to wait to the next polling when device is off. Useful to save up i/o and cpu when your device is not working. If you use only this binding to control the device, you can put higher values here. | 10            | All                           |
| pollingPeriodPowerOnSeconds   | Seconds to wait to the next polling for device state (dashboard channels)                                                                                                                                  | 10            | All                           |
| pollingExtraInfoPeriodSeconds | Seconds to wait to the next polling for Device's Extra Info (energy consumption, remaining filter, etc)                                                                                                    | 60            | Air Conditioner and Heat Pump |
| pollExtraInfoOnPowerOff       | If enables, extra info will be fetched in the polling process even when the device is powered off. It's not so common, since extra info are normally changed only when the device is running.              | Off           | Air Conditioner and Heat Pump |

#### Dashboard Channels

| channel #            | channel                       | type               | description                                                                    |

#### More Information

This Channel Group is reports useful information data for the device:

| channel #           | channel          | type      | description                                                |

OBS: some versions of this device can not support all the channels, depending on the model's capabilities.

## Full Example

Example of how to configure a thing.

### Example `demo.things`

```java
Bridge lgthinq:bridge:MyLGThinqBridge [ username="user@registered.com", password="cleartext-password", language="en", country="US", poolingIntervalSec=600] {
   Thing air-conditioner-401 myAC [ modelUrlInfo="<ac-model-url>", deviceId="<device-id>", platformType="<platform-type>", modelId="<model-id>", deviceAlias="<MyAC>" ]
}
```

Until now, there is no way to easily obtain the values of ac-model-url, device-id, platform-type and model-id. So, if you really need 
to configure the LGThinq thing textually, I suggest you to first add it with the UI discovery process through the LG Thinq Bridge, then after, copy
these properties from the thing created and complete the textual configuration.

Here are some examples on how to map the channels to items.

### Example `demo.items`

```java
Switch               ACPower        "Power"                   <switch>  { channel="lgthinq:air-conditioner-401:myAC:dashboard#power" }
Number               ACOpMode       "Operation Mode"          <text>    { channel="lgthinq:air-conditioner-401:myAC:dashboard#op-mode" }
Number:Temperature   ACTargetTemp   "Target Temperature"      <text>    { channel="lgthinq:air-conditioner-401:myAC:dashboard#target-temperature" }
Number:Temperature   ACCurrTemp     "Temperature"             <text>    { channel="lgthinq:air-conditioner-401:myAC:dashboard#current-temperature" }
Number               ACFanSpeed     "Fan Speed"               <text>    { channel="lgthinq:air-conditioner-401:myAC:dashboard#fan-speed" }
Switch               ACCoolJet      "CoolJet"                 <switch>  { channel="lgthinq:air-conditioner-401:myAC:dashboard#cool-jet" }
Switch               ACAutoDry      "Auto Dry"                <switch>  { channel="lgthinq:air-conditioner-401:myAC:dashboard#auto-dry" }
Switch               ACEnSaving     "Energy Saving"           <switch>  { channel="lgthinq:air-conditioner-401:myAC:dashboard#emergy-saving" }
Number               ACFanVDir      "Vertical Direction"      <text>    { channel="lgthinq:air-conditioner-401:myAC:dashboard#fan-step-up-down" }
```

### Example `demo.sitemap`

All the channels already have StateDescription for the selection Channels. So, unless you want to rename theirs into demo.items,
you can simply define as Selection that the default description of the values will be displayed.

```perl

sitemap demo label="Air Conditioner"
{
    Frame label="Dashboard" {
        Switch    item=ACPower
        Selection item=ACOpMode
        Selection item=ACTargetTemp
        Text      item=ACCurrTemp
        Selection item=ACFanSpeed
        Switch    item=ACCoolJet
        Switch    item=ACAutoDry
        Switch    item=ACEnSaving
        Selection item=ACFanSpeed
    }
}
```
