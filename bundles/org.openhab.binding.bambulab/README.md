# BambuLab Binding

This addon supports connecting with BambuLab 3D printers in local mode.
While cloud mode is theoretically possible, it is not supported by the addon developers.

## Cloud Mode

Cloud mode is possible but not officially supported by the addon developers.

To use cloud mode, follow these steps:

### Find Username

Log in to Maker World and visit [my-preferences](https://makerworld.com/api/v1/design-user-service/my/preference) to retrieve a JSON response containing your data. 
The relevant field is `uid`, which represents the unique ID of your account. 
Use this value as the `username` in the configuration (advanced field) with the prefix `u_`.

### Access Token

To obtain an access token, follow these steps:

1. Log in using your email and password.
2. Confirm the login using a token received via email.

#### Step 1: Login with Email and Password

```shell
curl -X POST "https://api.bambulab.com/v1/user-service/user/login" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "account": "you@email.io",
           "password": "superduperpassword123"
         }'
```

#### Step 2: Confirm Login with Token from Email

```shell
curl -X POST "https://api.bambulab.com/v1/user-service/user/login" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "account": "you@email.io",
           "code": "123456"
         }'
```

You will receive a long access code in the response. Copy it and use it as the `accessCode` parameter.

**Note:** This access code expires after three months. When it expires, repeat the process to obtain a new one.

### Hostname

Use `us.mqtt.bambulab.com` as the hostname.

## Supported Things

- `printer`: Represents a BambuLab 3D printer.

## Full Example

### `bambulab.things` Example

```java
Thing bambulab:printer:myprinter "My BambuLab Printer" @ "3D Printing Area" [
    serial="ABC123456789",
    hostname="192.168.1.100",
    accessCode="your_access_code_here"
]
```

### `bambulab.items` Example

```java
Number:Temperature NozzleTemperature "Nozzle Temperature [%.1f °C]" { channel="bambulab:printer:myprinter:nozzle-temperature" }
Number:Temperature BedTemperature "Bed Temperature [%.1f °C]" { channel="bambulab:printer:myprinter:bed-temperature" }
String PrintStage "Print Stage [%s]" { channel="bambulab:printer:myprinter:mc-print-stage" }
Switch LedChamber "Chamber LED" { channel="bambulab:printer:myprinter:led-chamber" }
```

## Actions

The printer thing supports actions:

```java
rule "test"
when
        /* when */
then
val actions = getActions("bambulab", "bambulab:printer:as8af03m38")
    if(actions !==null){
        // Refresh all channels
        actions.refreshChannels()
        actions.sendCommand("Pushing:1:1")
    }
end
```

### `refreshChannels`

Reports the complete status of the printer.
This is unnecessary for the X1 series since it already transmits the full object each time. 
However, the P1 series only sends the values that have been updated compared to the previous report.
As a rule of thumb, refrain from executing this command at intervals less than 5 minutes on the P1P, as it may cause lag due to its hardware limitations.

### `sendCommand`

The `sendCommand` method expects a string command in the format:

```
CommandType:Parameter1:Parameter2:...
```
