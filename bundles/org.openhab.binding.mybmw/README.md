# MyBMW Binding

The binding provides access like [MyBMW App](https://www.bmw.com/en/footer/mybmw-app.html) to openHAB.
All vehicles connected to an account will be detected by the discovery with the correct type:

- Conventional Fuel Vehicle
- Plugin-Hybrid Electrical Vehicle
- Battery Electric Vehicle with Range Extender
- Battery Electric Vehicle

In addition properties are attached with information and services provided by this vehicle.
The provided data depends on

1. the [Thing Type](#things) and
1. the [Properties](#properties) mentioned in Services

Different channel groups are clustering all information.
Check for each group if it's supported by your vehicle.

Please note **this isn't a real-time binding**.
If a door is opened the state isn't transmitted and changed immediately.
It's not a flaw in the binding itself because the state in BMW's own MyBMW App is also updated with some delay.

## Supported Things

### Bridge

The bridge establishes the connection between BMW API and openHAB.

| Name                       | Bridge Type ID | Description                              |
|----------------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------|
| MyBMW Account              | `account`      | Access to BMW API for a specific user    |

### Things

Four different vehicle types are provided.
They differ in the supported channel groups & channels.
Conventional Fuel Vehicles don't provide e.g. _Charging Profile_, Electric Vehicles don't provide a _Fuel Range_.
For hybrid vehicles in addition to _Fuel and Electric Range_ the _Hybrid Range_ is shown.

| Name                                | Thing Type ID | Supported Channel Groups                                            |
|-------------------------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| BMW Electric Vehicle                | `bev`         | Vehicle with electric drive train                                   |
| BMW Electric Vehicle with REX       | `bev_rex`     | Vehicle with electric drive train plus fuel powered range extender  |
| BMW Plug-In-Hybrid Electric Vehicle | `phev`        | Vehicle with combustion and electric drive train                    |
| BMW Conventional Vehicle            | `conv`        | Vehicle with combustion drive train                                 |

#### Properties

<img align="right" src="./doc/vehicle-properties.png" width="500" height="350"/>

For each vehicle properties are available.
Basic information is given regarding

- Vehicle properties like model type, drive train and construction year
- Which services are available / not available

In the right picture can see in _remoteServicesEnabled_ e.g. the _Door Lock_ and _Door Unlock_ services are mentioned.
This ensures channel group [Remote Services](#remote-services) is supporting door lock and unlock remote control.

In _Services Supported_ the entry _ChargingHistory_ is mentioned.
So it's valid to connect channel group [Charge Sessions](#charge-sessions) in order to display your last charging sessions.

| Property Key           | Property Value      |  Supported Channel Groups    |
|------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| servicesSupported      | ChargingHistory     | session                      |
| remoteServicesEnabled  | _list of services_  | remote                       |

## Discovery

Auto discovery is starting after the bridge is created.
A list of your registered vehicles is queried and all found things are added in the inbox.
Unique identifier is the _Vehicle Identification Number_ (VIN).
If a thing is already declared in a  _.things_ configuration, discovery won't highlight it again.
Properties will be attached to predefined vehicles if the VIN is matching.

## Configuration

## Channels

There are many channels available for each vehicle.
For better overview they are clustered in different channel groups.
They differ for each vehicle type, build-in sensors and activated services.

#### Vehicle Update

The BMW API has limits in the requests per time period.
This leads to unexpected errors stating that some quota is reached and the next successful request can be triggered in X minutes.
In this case the bridge as well as the vehicle things can be set to offline and nothing can be done with them anymore until the next successful refresh.
To reduce the probability of the error, the default automated API update has been set to 60 Minutes, but this is often not sufficient to retrieve continuous range or charging updates.
These channels can be used to control the update behavior from openHAB, e.g. via rules.

- Channel Group ID is status
- Available for all vehicles (charging channel only for xEV)
- switches which can be triggered by a command
- if the switches are set to ON, then immediately they will be set to OFF again for being able to trigger the next update

## Further Descriptions

### Dynamic Data

<img align="right" src="./doc/SessionOptions.png" width="400" height="250"/>

There are 3 occurrences of dynamic data delivered

- Upcoming Services delivered in group [Services](#services)
- Check Control Messages delivered in group [Check Control](#check-control)
- Charging Session data delivered in group [Charge Sessions](#charge-sessions)

The channel id _name_ shows the first element as default.
All other possibilities are attached as options.
The picture on the right shows the _Session Title_ item and 3 possible options.
Select the desired service and the corresponding Charge Session with _Energy Charged_, _Session Status_ and
_Session Issues_ will be shown.

### TroubleShooting

BMW has a high range of vehicles supported by their API.
In case of any issues with this binding help to resolve it!
Please perform the following steps:

- Can you log into MyBMW App with your credentials?
- Is the vehicle listed in your account?
- Is the [MyBMW Brige](#bridge) status _Online_?

If these preconditions are fulfilled proceed with the fingerprint generation.

#### Generate Debug Fingerprint

Login to the openHAB console and use the `mybmw fingerprint` command.

Fingerprint information on your account and vehicle(s) will show in the console and can be copiedfrom there.
A zip file with fingerprint information for your vehicle(s) will also be generated and put into the `mybmw` folder in the userdata folder.
This fingerprint information is valuable for the developers to better support your vehicle.

You can restrict the accounts and vehicles for the fingerprint generation.
Full syntax is available through the `mybmw help` console command.

Personal data is eliminated from fingerprints so it should be possible to share them in public.
Data like

- Vehicle Identification Number (VIN)
- Location data

are anonymized in the JSON response and URL's.

After the corresponding fingerprint is generated please [follow the instructions to raise an issue](https://community.openhab.org/t/how-to-file-an-issue/68464) and attach the fingerprint!

Your feedback is highly appreciated!

#### Debug Logging

You can [enable debug logging](https://www.openhab.org/docs/administration/logging.html#defining-what-to-log) to get more information on the behaviour of the binding.
The package.subpackage in this case would be "org.openhab.binding.mybmw".

As with fingerprint data, personal data is eliminated from logs.

### Range vs Range Radius

<img align="right" src="./doc/range-radius.png" width="400" height="350"/>

You will observe differences in the vehicle range and range radius values.
While range is indicating the possible distance to be driven on roads the range radius indicates the reachable range on the map.

The right picture shows the distance between Kassel and Frankfurt in Germany.
While the air-line distance is 145 kilometers the route distance is 192 kilometers.
So range value is the normal remaining range while the range radius values can be used e.g. on [Mapview](https://www.openhab.org/docs/ui/sitemaps.html#element-type-mapview) to indicate the reachable range on map.
Please note this is just an indicator of the effective range.
Especially for electric vehicles it depends on many factors like driving style and usage of electric consumers.

## Full Example

The example is based on a BMW i3 with range extender (REX).
Exchange configuration parameters in the Things section

- 4711 - any id you want
- YOUR_USERNAME - with your MyBMW login username
- YOUR_PASSWORD - with your MyBMW password credentials
- VEHICLE_VIN - the vehicle identification number

In addition search for all occurrences of _i3_ and replace it with your Vehicle Identification like _x3_ or _535d_ and you're ready to go!
