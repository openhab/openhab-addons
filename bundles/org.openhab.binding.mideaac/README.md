## Midea AC Binding

This binding integrates Air Conditioners that use the Midea protocol. Midea is an OEM for many brands.

An AC device is likely supported if it uses one of the following Android apps or it's iOS equivalent.
 
| Application						 		 |				Comment									 |
|:-------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------|
|Midea Air (com.midea.aircondition.obm)		 | Full Support of key and token updates				 |
|NetHome Plus (com.midea.aircondition)		 | Full Support of key and token updates				 |
|SmartHome/MSmartHome (com.midea.ai.overseas)| Full Support of key and token updates				 |

Note: The Air Conditioner must already be set-up on the WiFi network and must have a fixed IP Address 
	with one of the three apps listed above for full discovery and key and token updates.

## Supported Things

This binding supports one Thing type `ac`.

## Discovery

Once the Air Conditioner is on the network (WiFi active) it could be discovered automatically.
An IP broadcast message is sent and every responding unit gets added to the Inbox.

## Binding Configuration

No binding configuration is required.
