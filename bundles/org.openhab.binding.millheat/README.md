- `password` = password used in app
- `refreshInterval` = number of seconds between refresh calls to the server

### Home

- `homeId` = id of home, type number (not string). Use auto discovery to find this value

### Room

- `roomId` = id of room, type number (not string). Use auto discovery to find this value

### Heater

- `macAddress` = network mac address of device in UPPERCASE.
  Can be found in the app by viewing devices. Or you can find it during discovery. Used for heaters connected to a room.
- `heaterId` = id of device/heater, type number (not string)
  Use auto discovery to find this value. Used to identify independent heaters or heaters connected to a room.
- `power` = number of watts this heater is consuming when active.
  Used to provide data for the currentPower channel.

Either `macAddres` or `heaterId` must be specified.

## Setting up vacation mode

In order to activate vacation mode, follow these steps in a rule:

- Set start time (DateTime) on `DateTime` item linked to channel type `vacationModeStart`
- Set end time (DateTime) on `DateTime` item linked to channel type `vacationModeEnd`
- Activate vacation mode on `Switch` item linked to channel type `vacationMode`
- Optional - set advanced vacation mode on `Switch` item linked to channel type `vacationModeAdvanced`
