/**
 * Class to implement the BlueGiga command <b>readLong</b>.
 * <p>
 * This command can be used to read long attribute values, which are longer than 22 bytes and
 * cannot be read with a simple Read by Handle command. The command starts a procedure, where the
 * client first sends a normal read command to the server and if the returned attribute value
 * length is equal to MTU, the client will send further read long read requests until rest of the
 * attribute is read.
 * <p>
 * This class provides methods for processing BlueGiga API commands.
 * <p>
 * Note that this code is autogenerated. Manual changes may be overwritten.
