/**
 * Class to implement the BlueGiga command <b>userReadResponse</b>.
 * <p>
 * This command is used to respond to an attribute Read request by a remote device, but only for
 * attributes which have been configured with the user property. Attributes which have the
 * user property enabled allow the attribute value to be requested from the application
 * instead of the Smart stack automatically responding with Bluetooth the data in it's local
 * GATT database. This command is normally used in response to a User Read Request event, which
 * is generated when a remote device tries to read an attribute with a user property enabled. The
 * response to User Read Request events must happen within 30 seconds or otherwise a timeout
 * will occur.
 * <p>
 * This class provides methods for processing BlueGiga API commands.
 * <p>
 * Note that this code is autogenerated. Manual changes may be overwritten.
