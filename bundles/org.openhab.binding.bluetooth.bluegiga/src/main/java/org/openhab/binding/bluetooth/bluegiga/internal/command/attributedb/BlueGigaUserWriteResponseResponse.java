/**
 * Class to implement the BlueGiga command <b>userWriteResponse</b>.
 * <p>
 * This command is used by the GATT server to acknowledge to the remote device that the
 * attribute's value was written. This feature again allows the user application to
 * acknowledged the attribute write operations instead of the Smart stack doing it
 * automatically. Bluetooth The command should be used when an event is received where the
 * reason why value has changed Value corresponds to
 * attributes_attribute_change_reason_write_request_user. This response must be sent
 * within 30 seconds or otherwise a timeout will occur.
 * <p>
 * This class provides methods for processing BlueGiga API commands.
 * <p>
 * Note that this code is autogenerated. Manual changes may be overwritten.
