/**
 * Class to implement the BlueGiga command <b>connectDirect</b>.
 * <p>
 * This command will start the GAP direct connection establishment procedure to a dedicated
 * Smart Bluetooth device. The module will enter a state where it continuously scans for the
 * connectable advertisement packets Bluetooth from the remote device which matches the
 * Bluetooth address gives as a parameter. Upon receiving the advertisement packet, the
 * module will send a connection request packet to the target device to imitate a Bluetooth
 * connection. A successful connection will be indicated by an event. Status If the device is
 * configured to support more than one connection, the smallest connection interval which is
 * divisible by maximum_connections * 2.5ms will be selected. Thus, it is important to provide
 * minimum and maximum connection intervals so that such a connection interval is available
 * within the range. The connection establishment procedure can be cancelled with End
 * Procedure command.
 * <p>
 * This class provides methods for processing BlueGiga API commands.
 * <p>
 * Note that this code is autogenerated. Manual changes may be overwritten.
