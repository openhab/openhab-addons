/**
 * Class to implement the BlueGiga command <b>update</b>.
 * <p>
 * This command updates the connection parameters of a given connection. The parameters have
 * the same meaning and follow the same rules as for the GAP class command: Connect Direct. If
 * this command is issued at a master device, it will send parameter update request to the link
 * layer. Bluetooth On the other hand if this command is issued at a slave device, it will send
 * L2CAP connection parameter update request to the master, which may either accept or reject
 * it. It will take an amount of time corresponding to at least six times the current connection
 * interval before the new connection parameters will become active.
 * <p>
 * This class provides methods for processing BlueGiga API commands.
 * <p>
 * Note that this code is autogenerated. Manual changes may be overwritten.
