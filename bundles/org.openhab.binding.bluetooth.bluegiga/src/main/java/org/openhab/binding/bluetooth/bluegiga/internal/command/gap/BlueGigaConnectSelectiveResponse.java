/**
 * Class to implement the BlueGiga command <b>connectSelective</b>.
 * <p>
 * This command will start the GAP direct connection establishment procedure to a set of
 * dedicated Bluetooth Smart devices. When this command is issued the the module will enter a
 * state where it scans connectable Bluetooth advertisement packets from the remote devices
 * which are registered in the local white list. Upon receiving an advertisement packet from
 * one of the registered devices, the module will send a connection request to this device, and a
 * successful connection will produce a connection status event. The connect selective
 * command can be cancelled with End Procedure command. When in Initiating State there are no
 * scan response events.
 * <p>
 * This class provides methods for processing BlueGiga API commands.
 * <p>
 * Note that this code is autogenerated. Manual changes may be overwritten.
