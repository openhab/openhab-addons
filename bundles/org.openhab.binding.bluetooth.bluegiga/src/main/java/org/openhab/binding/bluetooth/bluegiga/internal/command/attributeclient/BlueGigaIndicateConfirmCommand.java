/**
 * Class to implement the BlueGiga command <b>indicateConfirm</b>.
 * <p>
 * This command can be used to send a acknowledge a received indication from a remote device.
 * This function allows the application to manually confirm the indicated values instead of
 * the smart stack Bluetooth automatically doing it. The benefit of this is extra reliability
 * since the application can for example store the received value on the flash memory before
 * confirming the indication to the remote device.
 * <p>
 * This class provides methods for processing BlueGiga API commands.
 * <p>
 * Note that this code is autogenerated. Manual changes may be overwritten.
