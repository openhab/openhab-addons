# OpenSprinkler Binding

This binding allows good and flexible control over your OpenSprinkler devices.
You can choose to manually start, stop or delay the stand alone watering programs that are stored and run fully from the OpenSprinkler device.
Alternatively you can setup openHAB rules to control everything in more depth by setting up multiple `station` things for each watering zone to gain more in depth control.
By using the internal programs and sensors of the OpenSprinkler device, it can remove the complexity of what happens to the watering if openHAB crashes, is rebooted, or drops out of WiFi range in the middle of your watering rules.
Mixing the two concepts can also be done, the choice is yours.

## Supported Bridges

- `OpenSprinkler HTTP Bridge` is required to communicate with an OpenSprinkler device through the network and should be added first.

## Supported Things

- `OpenSprinkler Station` is for gaining advanced controls and status information over a single station (zone) of a device, e.g. to turn it on or off, or the time remaining.
- `OpenSprinkler Device` is for device-specific controls that usually apply to multiple stations or main unit sensors, e.g. if rain was detected.

Recommend that you first add a single `device` thing and then if you need the extra controls, add as many of the `station` things as you wish.

## Discovery

OpenSprinkler devices can be discovered by the binding sending requests to every IP on your network.
Due to this method used, it is very slow at finding devices and can saturate network bandwidth.

## Bridge ('http') Configuration

- hostname: Hostname or IP address of the OpenSprinkler HTTP API.
- port: Port the OpenSprinkler device is listening on. Usually 80.
- password: Admin password of the API. Factory default is: opendoor
- refresh: Number of seconds in between refreshing the Thing state with the API.
- timeout: (optional) Number of seconds to wait for a timeout when calling the OpenSprinkler HTTP API.
- retry: (optional) Number of retries on connection timeouts.
- basicUsername: (optional) Only needed when the OpenSprinkler device is behind a basic auth enforcing reverse proxy.
- basicPassword: (optional) Only needed when the OpenSprinkler device is behind a basic auth enforcing reverse proxy.

### Station Thing Configuration

The `station` thing must be used with a `http` bridge and has the following configuration properties:

- stationIndex: The index of the station to communicate with, starting with 0 for the first station

## Channels

The following channels are supported by the `station` thing.

| Channel Type ID    | Item Type   |    | Description                                              |
|--------------------|-------------|----|----------------------------------------------------------|
| stationState       | Switch      | RW | This channel indicates whether the station is on or off. |
| remainingWaterTime | Number:Time | R  | The time the station remains to be open.                 |
| nextDuration       | Number:Time | RW | The amount of time that will be used to keep the station |
|                    |             |    | open when next manually switched on. If not set, this    |
|                    |             |    | value will default to 18 hours which is the maximum time |
|                    |             |    | supported.                                               |
| queued             | Switch      | RW | Indicates that the station is queued to be turned on.    |
|                    |             |    | The channel cannot be turned on, only turning it off is  |
|                    |             |    | supported (which removes the station from the queue).    |
| ignoreRain         | Switch      | RW | This channel makes the station ignore the rain delay.    |

When using the `nextDuration` channel, it is advised to setup persistence (e.g. MapDB) in order to persist the value through restarts.

The following channels are supported by the `device` thing.
NOTE: Some channels will only show up if the hardware has the required sensor and is setup correctly.

| Channel Type ID | Item Type              |    | Description                                                                        |

| currentDraw     | Number:ElectricCurrent | RO | Shows the current draw of the device.                                              |
| enablePrograms  | Switch                 | RW | Allow programs to auto run. When OFF, manually started stations will still work.   |
| flowSensorCount | Number:Dimensionless   | RO | Shows the number of pulses the optional water flow sensor has reported.            |
| nextDuration    | Number:Time            | RW | The time the station will open for when any stations are selected from the         |
|                 |                        |    | `stations` channel. Defaults to 30 minutes if not set.                           |
| pausePrograms   | Number:Time            | RW | Sets/Shows the amount of time that programs will be paused for.                    |
| programs        | String                 | RW | Displays a list of the programs that are setup in your OpenSprinkler and when      |
|                 |                        |    | selected will start that program for you.                                          |

| resetStations   | Switch                 | RW | The ON command will stop all stations immediately, including those waiting to run. |
| sensor2         | Switch                 | RO | This channel is for the second sensor (if your hardware supports it).              |
