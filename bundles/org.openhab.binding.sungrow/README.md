# Sungrow Binding

Binding for accessing the Sungrow Cloud via [Sungrow Developer Portal](https://developer-api.isolarcloud.com/).

To use this binding you have to login at [Sungrow Developer Portal](https://developer-api.isolarcloud.com/) and
create an application. With this application Sungrow will provide the data needed
to access the APIs.

You must create an Application which do **not** support "Authorize with OAuth2.0".

## Supported Things

The Binding creates a bridge for access to the API and creates a thing for each plant.

- `bridge`: Access to the APIs
- `plant`: The different Plants the user is granted.

## Binding Configuration

_If your binding requires or supports general configuration settings, please create a folder ```cfg``` and place the configuration file ```<bindingId>.cfg``` inside it._
_In this section, you should link to this file and provide some information about the options._
_The file could e.g. look like:_

```
# Configuration for the Sungrow Binding
#
# Default secret key for the pairing of the Sungrow Thing.
# It has to be between 10-40 (alphanumeric) characters.
# This may be changed by the user for security reasons.
secret=openHABSecret
```

_Note that it is planned to generate some part of this based on the information that is available within ```src/main/resources/OH-INF/binding``` of your binding._

_If your binding does not offer any generic configurations, you can remove this section completely._

## Thing Configuration

_Describe what is needed to manually configure a thing, either through the UI or via a thing-file._
_This should be mainly about its mandatory and optional configuration parameters._

_Note that it is planned to generate some part of this based on the XML files within ```src/main/resources/OH-INF/thing``` of your binding._

### `sample` Thing Configuration

## Channels

_Here you should provide information about available channel types, what their meaning is and how they can be used._

_Note that it is planned to generate some part of this based on the XML files within ```src/main/resources/OH-INF/thing``` of your binding._
