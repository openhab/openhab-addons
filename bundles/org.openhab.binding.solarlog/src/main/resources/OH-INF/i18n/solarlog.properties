# binding

binding.solarlog.name = Solar-Log Binding
binding.solarlog.description = This is the binding for the Solar-Log product range developed and sold by Solare Datensysteme GmbH. The Solar-Log devices allow monitoring of Photovoltaic (PV) installations and provide a JSON API to extract data. This includes information about current energy production and use, and other vital parameters of a PV installation. This binding makes this data accessible to openHAB from where it can be persistently stored, used to trigger actions or be displayed for information.
