	<description>This is the binding for the Omnik solar grid inverters. The integration is based on the undocumented API,
		which is reverse engineered at https://github.com/Woutrrr/Omnik-Data-Logger. As such, the known supported inverters
		are known to work with inverters with wifi bridge which start with the serial number '602' and '606'.</description>
