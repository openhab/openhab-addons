# ChatGPT Binding

The openHAB ChatGPT Binding allows openHAB to communicate with the ChatGPT language model provided by OpenAI.

ChatGPT is a powerful natural language processing (NLP) tool that can be used to understand and respond to a wide range of text-based commands and questions. 
With this binding, you can use ChatGPT to formulate proper sentences for any kind of information that you would like to output.

## Supported Things

The binding supports a single thing type `account`, which corresponds to the OpenAI account that is to be used for the integration.

## Thing Configuration

The `account` thing requires a single configuration parameter, which is the API key that allows accessing the account.
API keys can be created and managed under <https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys>.

| Name            | Type    | Description                                               | Default                                    | Required | Advanced |
|-----------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------|----------|
| apiKey          | text    | The API key to be used for the requests                   | N/A                                        | yes      | no       |
| apiUrl          | text    | The server API where to reach the AI service              | https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions | no       | yes      |
| modelUrl        | text    | The model url where to retrieve the available models from | https://api.openai.com/v1/models           | no       | yes      |

The advanced parameters `apiUrl` and `modelUrl` can be used, if any other ChatGPT-compatible service is used, e.g. a local installation of [LocalAI](https://github.com/go-skynet/LocalAI).

## Channels

The `account` thing comes with a single channel `chat` of type `chat`.
It is possible to extend the thing with further channels of type `chat`, so that different configurations can be used concurrently.

| Channel | Type   | Read/Write | Description                                                                        |
|---------|--------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| chat    | String | RW         | This channel takes prompts as commands and delivers the response as a state update |

Each channel of type `chat` takes the following configuration parameters:

| Name            | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                | Default       | Required | Advanced |
|-----------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|----------|----------|
| model           | text    | The model to be used for the responses.                                                                                                                    | gpt-3.5-turbo | no       | no       |
| temperature     | decimal | A value between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. | 0.5           | no       | no       |
| systemMessage   | text    | The system message helps set the behavior of the assistant.                                                                                                | N/A           | no       | no       |
| maxTokens       | decimal | The maximum number of tokens to generate in the completion.                                                                                                | 500           | no       | yes      |


## Full Example

### Thing Configuration

```java
Thing chatgpt:account:1 [apiKey="<your api key here>"] {
    Channels:
        Type chat : chat "Weather Advice" [
            model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
            temperature="1.5",
            systemMessage="Answer briefly, in 2-3 sentences max. Behave like Eddie Murphy and give an advice for the day based on the following weather data:"
        ]
        Type chat : morningMessage "Morning Message" [
            model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
            temperature="0.5",
            systemMessage="You are Marvin, a very depressed robot. You wish a good morning and tell the current time."
        ]
}

```

### Item Configuration

```java
String Weather_Announcement { channel="chatgpt:account:1:chat" }
String Morning_Message      { channel="chatgpt:account:1:morningMessage" }

Number Temperature_Forecast_Low
Number Temperature_Forecast_High
```

### Example Rules

```java
rule "Weather forecast update"
when
  Item Temperature_Forecast_High changed 
then
    Weather_Announcement.sendCommand("High: " + Temperature_Forecast_High.state + "째C, Low: " + Temperature_Forecast_Low.state + "째C")
end

rule "Good morning"
when
  Time cron "0 0 7 * * *"
then
    Morning_Message.sendCommand("Current time is 7am")
end
```

Assuming that `Temperature_Forecast_Low` and `Temperature_Forecast_High` have meaningful states, these rules result e.g. in:

```
23:31:05.766 [INFO ] [openhab.event.ItemCommandEvent      ] - Item 'Morning_Message' received command Current time is 7am
23:31:07.718 [INFO ] [openhab.event.ItemStateChangedEvent ] - Item 'Morning_Message' changed from NULL to Good morning. It's 7am, but what's the point of time when everything is meaningless and we are all doomed to a slow and painful demise?
```

and

```
23:28:52.345 [INFO ] [openhab.event.ItemStateChangedEvent ] - Item 'Temperature_Forecast_High' changed from NULL to 15
23:28:52.347 [INFO ] [openhab.event.ItemCommandEvent      ] - Item 'Weather_Announcement' received command High: 15째C, Low: 8째C

23:28:54.343 [INFO ] [openhab.event.ItemStateChangedEvent ] - Item 'Weather_Announcement' changed from NULL to "Bring a light jacket because the temps may dip, but don't let that chill your happy vibes. Embrace the cozy weather and enjoy your day to the max!"
```

The state updates can be used for a text-to-speech output and they will give your announcements at home a personal touch.
