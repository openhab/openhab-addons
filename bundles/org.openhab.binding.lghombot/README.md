# LG HomBot Binding

The binding integrates a modified LG HomBot VR6260 based vacuum robots.
Details on how to modify your HomBot can be found at [roboter-forum.com](https://www.roboter-forum.com/index.php?thread/10009-lg-hombot-3-0-wlan-kamera-steuerung-per-weboberfl√§che/).
The binding uses the HTTP service on port 6260 right now.
Please take care when modifying your HomBot! This binding is a complement to a modified HomBot not an excuse to do the modification.
Remember, You are responsible if You brick Your HomBot.

## Supported Things

Hacked LG HomBot series 62XX are supported.

The service that the binding connects to is actually lg.srv found at [sourceforge.net](https://sourceforge.net/projects/lgsrv/) running on a HomBot.

## Discovery

The auto-discovery should hopefully find your HomBot, be aware that it will try to connect to port 6260 on all IP-addresses on your subnet.
If you already know the IP-address of your HomBot you might as well just configure it.

## Thing Configuration

The thing only requires an IP-address to function, this could also be found using the discovery method.
The parameter is called "ipAdress".

You can also configure the polling interval in seconds by setting "pollingPeriod", and the network port of the server by using "port".
