# IRtrans Binding

This binding integrates infrared receivers and blasters manufactured by IRtrans (www.irtrans.de)

## Supported Things

The _ethernet_ Bridge supports the Ethernet (PoE) IRtrans transceiver equipped with an on-board IRDB database. Blasters and receivers are defined as Channels on the Bridge, but one can also define blasters as a _blaster_ child Thing on the Bridge.

## Discovery

There is no Discovery feature available.

## Binding Configuration

There is no specific binding configuration required.

## Thing Configuration

The _ethernet_ Bridge requires an _ipAddress_ IP address and _portNumber_ TCP port number in order to configure it. Optionally, one can add the following parameters to the configuration:

_bufferSize_ : Buffer size used by the TCP socket when sending and receiving commands to the transceiver (default: 1024)
_responseTimeOut_ : Specifies the time milliseconds to wait for a response from the transceiver when sending a command (default: 100)
_pingTimeOut_ : Specifies the time milliseconds to wait for a response from the transceiver when pinging the device (default: 1000)
_reconnectInterval_ : Specifies the time seconds to wait before reconnecting to a transceiver after a communication failure (default: 10)

The _blaster_ Thing requires a _led_ parameter to specify on which infrared commands will be emitted, _remote_ the remote or manufacturer name which's commands will be allowed, as defined in the IRtrans server database that is flashed into the transceiver (can be ' \*' for 'any' remote), and _command_ the name of the command will be allowed, as defined in the IRtrans server database that is flashed into the transceiver (can be '*' for 'any' command).

## Channels

The _ethernet_ Thing supports the following Channel Types:

| Channel Type ID | Item Type | Description                                                                         |
|-----------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| blaster         | String    | Send (filtered) infrared commands over the specified blaster LED of the transceiver |
| receiver        | String    | Receive (filtered) infrared commands on the receiver LED of the transceiver         |

The _blaster_ Channel Type requires a _led_ configuration parameter to specify on which infrared commands will be emitted, _remote_ the remote or manufacturer name which's commands will be allowed, as defined in the IRtrans server database that is flashed into the transceiver (can be '\*' for 'any' remote), and _command_ the name of the command will be allowed, as defined in the IRtrans server database that is flashed into the transceiver (can be '*' for 'any' command).

The _receiver_ Channel Type requires _remote_ the remote or manufacturer name which's commands will be allowed, as defined in the IRtrans server database that is flashed into the transceiver (can be '\*' for 'any' remote), and _command_ the name of the command will be allowed, as defined in the IRtrans server database that is flashed into the transceiver (can be '*' for 'any' command).

The _blaster_ Thing supports a _io_ Channel (of Item Type String) that allows to read infrared commands received by the blaster, as well as to write infrared commands to be sent by the blaster.

The IRtrans transceivers store infrared commands in a "remote,command" table, e.g. "telenet,power". Sending the literal text string "telenet,power" to the transceiver will make the transceiver "translate" that into the actual infrared command that will be emitted by the transceiver.  A "remote,command" string sent to a Channel that does not match the defined filter will be ignored.

## Full Example

demo.things:

```java
Bridge irtrans:ethernet:kitchen [ ipAddress="192.168.0.56", portNumber=21000, bufferSize=1024, responseTimeOut=100, pingTimeOut=2000, reconnectInterval=10 ]
{
Channels:
Type receiver : any [remote="*", command="*"]
Type receiver : telenet_power [remote="telenet", command="power"]
Type blaster : samsung [led="E", remote="samsung", command="*"]
}
```

In the above example, the first channel will be updated when any IR command from any type of device is received. The second channel will only be updated if a "power" infrared command from the remote/device type "telenet" is received. The third channel can be used to feed any type of infrared command to a Samsung television by means of the "E" emitter of the IRtrans device.
The led can be "E"-External, "I"-Internal, "B"-Both, and a numeric for a selected led.
Depending on the number of remotes, the bufferSize must be adjusted. E.g. for 7 remotes and 47 commands a bufferSize of 2048 is needed.

```java
Bridge irtrans:ethernet:technicalfacilities [ ipAddress="192.168.0.58", portNumber=21000, bufferSize=1024, responseTimeOut=100, pingTimeOut=2000, reconnectInterval=10 ]
{
Channels:
Type receiver : any [remote="*", command="*"]
Type blaster : telenet1 [led="2", remote="telenet", command="*"]
Type blaster : telenet2 [led="1", remote="telenet", command="*"]
Type blaster : appletv [led="3", remote="appletv", command="*"]
}
```

In the above channel a single IRtrans transceiver has 3 output LEDs in use, 2 to drive 2 DTV SetTopBoxes, and a third one to drive an Apple TV device.

String KitchenIRReceiverAny {channel="irtrans:ethernet:kitchen:any"}
String KitchenIRReceiverTelenetPower {channel="irtrans:ethernet:kitchen:telenet_power"}
String KitchenIRBlasterSamsung {channel="irtrans:ethernet:kitchen:samsung"}

String TechnicalFacilitiesIRReceiverAny {channel="irtrans:ethernet:technicalfacilities:any"}
String TechnicalFacilitiesIRBlasterTelenet2 {channel="irtrans:ethernet:technicalfacilities:telenet2"}
String TechnicalFacilitiesIRBlasterTelenet1 {channel="irtrans:ethernet:technicalfacilities:telenet1"}
String TechnicalFacilitiesIRBlasterAppleTV {channel="irtrans:ethernet:technicalfacilities:appletv"}
```

demo.rules:

```java
rule "Kitchen switch IR rule"
when
    Item KitchenIRReceiverTelenetPower received update
then
    createTimer(now.plusSeconds(5)) [|
        KitchenIRBlasterSamsung.sendCommand("samsung,power")
        ]
end
```
