# This workflow can be used to trigger a rebuild of checks for a certain PR.
#
# Automatic triggering is based on PR labeled event.
# The workflow will check if the new label is "rebuild".
# It triggers up to 3 check runs taken from the PR and triggers all their jobs again, independent
# of the previous status. (3 is an arbitrary number, it was just necessary to have more than one in
# case there are different relevant workflows, e.g. build and codeql. This could be limited to
# checks marked as "required" or "failed", but it seems better to trigger all).
# The label "rebuild" is removed after the rebuild is triggered.
#
# It can be triggered manually, referencing a PR number (this is mainly for testing purposes).
