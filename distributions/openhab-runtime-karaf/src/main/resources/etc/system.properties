# Log level when the pax-logging service is not available
# This level will only be used while the pax-logging service bundle
# is not fully available.
# To change log levels, please refer to the org.ops4j.pax.logging.cfg file

#
# Roles to use when for the default user in the local Karaf console.
#
# The syntax is the following:
#   [classname:]principal
# where classname is the class name of the principal object
# (defaults to org.apache.karaf.jaas.modules.RolePrincipal)
# and principal is the name of the principal of that class
# (defaults to instance).

# By default, we will not weave any classes. Change this setting to include classes
# that you application needs to have woven.

# secured by expanding this filter
#

#
# By default, if there's no ACL policy for a certain karaf command, this command is allowed to access
# without the RBAC. We can change this behavior by enable the following property, which means
# if a karaf command has no corresponding ACL then access it must have one of the karaf.secured.command.compulsory.roles
#
#karaf.secured.command.compulsory.roles=admin

#
# Security properties
#
# To enable OSGi security, uncomment the properties below,
# install the framework-security feature and restart.
#
#java.security.policy=${karaf.etc}/all.policy
#org.osgi.framework.security=osgi
#org.osgi.framework.trust.repositories=${karaf.etc}/trustStore.ks

#
# HA/Lock configuration
#
# Karaf uses a lock mechanism to know which instance is the master (HA)
# The lock can be on the filesystem (default) or on a database.
#
# See http://karaf.apache.org/manual/latest/users-guide/failover.html for details.
#
# Even using a single instance, Karaf creates the lock file
# You can specify the location of the lock file using the
# karaf.lock.dir=/path/to/the/directory/containing/the/lock
#
