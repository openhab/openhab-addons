# Nest Binding Tests

[Nest Labs](https://nest.com/) developed/acquired the Wi-Fi enabled Nest Learning Thermostat, the Nest Protect Smoke+CO detector, and the Nest Cam.
These devices are supported by this binding, which communicates with the Nest API over a secure, RESTful API to Nest's servers.
Monitoring ambient temperature and humidity, changing HVAC mode, changing heat or cool setpoints, monitoring and changing your "home/away" status, and monitoring your Nest Protects and Nest Cams can be accomplished through this binding.

This binding is to test and verify the nest binding.
