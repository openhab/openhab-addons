# parameters
parameter.serialport.label = Serial Port
parameter.serialport.description = The serial port name for the USB receiver. Valid values are e.g. COM1 for Windows and /dev/ttyS0 or /dev/ttyUSB0 for Linux.
parameter.baudrate.label = Baud Rate
parameter.baudrate.description = The baud rate of the USB Receiver. Valid values are 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600 (default), and 115200.
parameter.ipaddress.label = IP Address
parameter.ipaddress.description = The IP address of the Server to which the USB Receiver is connected.
parameter.port.label = TCP Port
parameter.port.description = The TCP port over which the serial port is made available.
parameter.sketchname.label = Sketch Name
parameter.sketchname.description = The name of the sketch that has been flashed to the USB Receiver.
parameter.initcommands.label = Init Commands
parameter.initcommands.description = Optional initialization commands (semicolon separated) that will be send after connecting, e.g. "0a v" to turn of the LED.
parameter.sensorid.label = Sensor ID
parameter.sensorid.description = The sensor ID used by this sensor.
parameter.updateinterval.label = Update Interval
parameter.updateinterval.description = The update interval in seconds (0 puts the sensor in live mode). Setting this to a value greater than zero only makes sense if you specify a buffer size greater one. 
parameter.sensortimeout.label = Sensor Timeout
parameter.sensortimeout.description = The amount of time that should result in OFFLINE status when no readings have been received from the sensor (in seconds).
parameter.buffersize.label = Buffer Size
parameter.buffersize.description = The amount of readings that should be used to compute a rolling average (1 disables the rolling average).
parameter.mintemp.label = Lower Temperature Limit
parameter.mintemp.description = The lowest temperature allowed as valid reading from the sensor. All lower readings will be ignored.
parameter.maxtemp.label = Upper Temperature Limit
parameter.maxtemp.description = The highest temperature allowed as valid reading from the sensor. All higher readings will be ignored.
parameter.maxdiff.label = Maximum Allowed Temperature Difference
parameter.maxdiff.description = The maximum allowed absolute difference from a value to the previous value (0 disables this check). If the difference is higher, the reading will be ignored.
parameter.sendCount.label = Switching Command Count
parameter.sendCount.description = The number of times a switching command will be sent (every 2 seconds) to the socket until giving up. 

# channel types
channel-type.current-watt.label = Current Watt
channel-type.current-watt.description = The current consumption of the appliance in W.
channel-type.max-watt.label = Max Watt
channel-type.max-watt.description = The maximum consumption of the appliance in W.
channel-type.consumption-total.label = Total Consumption
channel-type.consumption-total.description = The total consumption of the connected appliance.
channel-type.appliance-time.label = Appliance On Time
channel-type.appliance-time.description = The number of hours the appliance was turned on.
channel-type.sensor-time.label = Sensor On Time
channel-type.sensor-time.description = The number of hours the EC3000 was connected to an outlet.
channel-type.resets.label = Resets
channel-type.resets.description = Number of resets performed by the sensor.
channel-type.temperature.label = Temperature
channel-type.temperature.description = The temperature read from the sensor.
channel-type.humidity.label = Humidity
channel-type.humidity.description = The humidity read from the sensor.
channel-type.battery-new.label = Battery New
channel-type.battery-new.description = Indicator for new battery.
channel-type.switching-state.label = Switching State
channel-type.switching-state.description = Whether the socket is currently switched on or not.
