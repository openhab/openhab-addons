Release 4.4 Final
-------------------

This is the first stable (GA) release of HttpClient 4.4. Notable features and enhancements included
in 4.4 series are:

* Support for the latest HTTP state management specification (RFC 6265). Please note that the old
cookie policy is still used by default for compatibility reasons. RFC 6265 compliant cookie
policies need to be explicitly configured by the user. Please also note that as of next feature
release support for Netscape draft, RFC 2109 and RFC 2965 cookie policies will be deprecated
and disabled by default. It is recommended to use RFC 6265 compliant policies for new applications
unless compatibility with RFC 2109 and RFC 2965 is required and to migrate existing applications
to the default cookie policy.

* Enhanced, redesigned and rewritten default SSL hostname verifier with improved RFC 2818
compliance

* Default SSL hostname verifier and default cookie policy now validate certificate identity
and cookie domain of origin against the public suffix list maintained by Mozilla.org
<https://publicsuffix.org/list>

* More efficient stale connection checking: indiscriminate connection checking which results
in approximately 20 to 50 ms overhead per request has been deprecated in favor of conditional
connection state validation (persistent connections are to be re-validated only if a specified
period inactivity has elapsed)

* Authentication cache thread-safety: authentication cache used by HttpClient is now thread-safe
and can be shared by multiple threads in order to re-use authentication state for subsequent
requests

* Native Windows Negotiate and NTLM via SSPI through JNA: when running on Windows OS HttpClient
configured to use native NTLM or SPNEGO authentication schemes can make use of platform specific
functionality via JNA and current user credentials. This functionality is still considered
experimental, known to have compatibility issues and subject to change without prior notice.
Use at your discretion.

This release also includes all fixes from the stable 4.3.x release branch.

Please note that as of 4.4 HttpClient requires Java 1.6 or newer.

release 4.3.

Users of HttpClient 4.3 are strongly encouraged to upgrade.

Changelog

Release 4.3 Final
-------------------

This is the first stable (GA) release of HttpClient 4.3. The most notable enhancements included
in this release are:

* Support for Java 7 try-with-resources for resource management (connection release.)

* Added fluent Builder classes for HttpEntity, HttpRequest, HttpClient and SSLContext instances.

* Deprecation of preference and configuration API based on HttpParams interface in favor of
constructor injection and plain configuration objects.

* Reliance on object immutability instead of access synchronization for thread safety.
Several old classes whose instances can be shared by multiple request exchanges have
been replaced by immutable equivalents.

* DefaultHttpClient,  DecompressingHttpClient, CachingHttpClient and similar classes are
deprecated in favor of builder classes that produce immutable HttpClient instances.

* HttpClient builders now dynamically construct a request execution pipeline tailored
specifically to the user configuration by physically excluding unnecessary protocol components.

* There is now an option to construct a minimal HttpClient implementation that can only execute
basic HTTP message exchanges without redirects, authentication, state management or proxy support.
This feature might be of particular use in web crawler development.

* There is now option to avoid strict URI syntax for request URIs by executing HTTP requests
with an explicitly specified target host. HttpClient will no longer attempt to parse the request
URI if it does not need to extract the target host from it.

This release also includes all fixes from the stable 4.2.x release branch.

HttpClient 4.2.1 (GA) is a bug fix release that addresses a number of issues reported since
release 4.2.

Release 4.2
-------------------

This is the first stable (GA) release of HttpClient 4.2. The most notable enhancements included
in this release are:

* New facade API for HttpClient based on the concept of a fluent interface. The fluent API exposes
  only the most fundamental functions of HttpClient and is intended for relatively simple use cases
  that do not require the full flexibility of HttpClient. However, the fluent API almost fully
  relieves the users from having to deal with connection management and resource deallocation.

* Redesigned and rewritten connection management code.

* Enhanced HTTP authentication API that enables HttpClient to handle more complex authentication
  scenarios. HttpClient 4.2 is now capable of making use of multiple authentication challenges
  and retry authentication with a fall-back scheme in case the primary one fails. This can be
  important for compatibility with Microsoft products that are often configured to use
  SPNEGO/Kerberos as the preferred authentication scheme.


Changelog

  consume its content resulting in a connection leak.

  self-signed certificates).

* Simplified configuration for connection managers.

* Transparent support for host multihoming.

IMPORTANT: please note that the HttpClient 3.x branch is now officially END OF LIFE and is no longer
maintained and supported by the Apache HttpComponents project.

Changelog
-------------------
* The public API for the caching module had a minor change between 4.1-beta and 4.1-GA to the
  HttpCacheEntry class - the deprecated public Set<String> getVariantURIs() method and constructor
  public HttpCacheEntry(Date requestDate, Date responseDate,
            StatusLine statusLine, Header[] responseHeaders,
            Resource resource, Set<String> variants)
  were both removed.  This will not affect you unless you are implementing new storage backends
  that use the deprecated code and/or are implementing custom serializers for cache entries.

* Changed Browser-Compatibility and Best-Match cookie policies to emulate the behaviour of FireFox
  more closely when parsing Netscape style cookies. Comma will no longer be treated as a header
  element separator if Set-Cookie does not contain a Version attribute mandated by the
  RFC2109 / RFC 2965 cookie specifications.
  Contributed by Oleg Kalnichevski <olegk at apache.org>

  advantage of shortcut logic.
  Contributed by Sebastian Bazley <sebb at apache.org>

* [HTTPCLIENT-1030] Implement "ignoreCookies" CookieSpec
  Contributed by Sebastian Bazley <sebb at apache.org>

This is a bug fix release that addresses a number of issues discovered since
the previous stable release. None of the fixed bugs is considered critical.
Most notably this release eliminates eliminates dependency on JCIP annotations.

This release is also expected to improve performance by 5 to 10% due to
elimination of unnecessary Log object lookups by short-lived components.

Release 4.0
-------------------

HttpClient 4.0 represents a complete, ground-up redesign and almost a complete
rewrite of the HttpClient 3.x codeline. This release finally addresses several
design flaws that existed since the 1.0 release and could not be fixed without
a major code overhaul and breaking API compatibility.


Architectural changes
---------------------

* Redesign of the HttpClient internals addressing all known major
  architectural shortcomings of the 3.x codeline.

* Cleaner, more flexible and expressive API.

* More modular structure.

* Better performance and smaller memory footprint due to a more efficient HTTP
  transport based on HttpCore.

* Implementation of cross-cutting HTTP protocol aspects through protocol
  interceptors.

* Improved connection management, better handling of persistent connections,
  support for stateful connections

* Pluggable redirect and authentication handlers.

* Improved support for sending requests via a proxy or a chain of proxies

* More flexible SSL context customization

* Reduced intermediate garbage in the process of generating HTTP requests
  and parsing HTTP responses


Important notes
-------------------

* Future releases of HttpMime module may be binary incompatible with this
  release due to possible API changes in Apache Mime4J. Apache Mime4J is
  still being actively developed and its API is considered unstable.

* HttpClient 4.0 is not fully binary compatible with 4.0 BETA1 release.
  Some protected variables in connection management class have been
  made final in order to help ensure their thread safety:

    org.apache.http.conn.BasicEofSensorWatcher#attemptReuse
    org.apache.http.conn.BasicEofSensorWatcher#managedConn
    org.apache.http.impl.conn.DefaultClientConnectionOperator#schemeRegistry

ones is the capability to handle stateful connections such as persistent
NTLM connections and private key authenticated SSL connections.

This is the first API stable release of HttpClient 4.0. All further
releases in the 4.0 code line will maintain API compatibility with this
release.

There has been a number of important bug fixes since ALPHA4. All upstream
projects are encouraged to upgrade to the latest release.

Please note HttpClient currently provides only limited support for NTLM
authentication. For details please see NTLM_SUPPORT.txt.

Release 4.0 Alpha 4
-------------------

ALPHA4 marks the completion of the overhaul of the connection management
code in HttpClient. All known shortcomings of the old HttpClient 3.x
connection management API have been addressed.

NTLM authentication remains the only missing major feature in the new
codeline that prevents us from moving awards the API freeze.

There has been a number of important bug fixes since ALPHA3. All upstream
projects are encouraged to upgrade to the latest release.

--------------------------------------

Release 4.0 Alpha 3
-------------------

ALPHA3 release brings another round of API refinements and improvements in
functionality. As of this release HttpClient requires Java 5 compatible
runtime environment and takes full advantage of generics and new concurrency
primitives.

This release also introduces new default cookie policy that selects a cookie
specification depending on the format of cookies sent by the target host.
It is no longer necessary to know beforehand what kind of HTTP cookie support
the target host provides. HttpClient is now able to pick up either a lenient
or a strict cookie policy depending on the compliance level of the target host.

Another notable improvement is a completely reworked support for multipart
entities based on Apache mime4j library.

--------------------------------------

Release 4.0 Alpha 1
-------------------

HttpClient 4.0 represents a complete, ground-up redesign and almost a complete
rewrite of the HttpClient 3.x codeline. This release finally addresses several
design flaws that existed since the 1.0 release and could not be fixed without
a major code overhaul and breaking API compatibility.

The HttpClient 4.0 API is still very experimental and is bound to change
during the course of the ALPHA development phase. Several important features
have not yet been ported to the new API.

Architectural changes
---------------------

* Redesign of the HttpClient internals addressing all known
  major architectural shortcomings of the 3.x codeline

* Cleaner, more flexible and expressive API

* Better performance and smaller memory footprint due to a more
  efficient HTTP transport based on HttpCore. HttpClient 4.0 is
  expected to be 10% to 25% faster than HttpClient 3.x codeline

* More modular structure

* Pluggable redirect and authentication handlers

* Support for protocol incerceptors

* Improved connection management

* Improved support for sending requests via a proxy or a chain of
  proxies

* Improved handling redirects of entity enclosing requests

* More flexible SSL context customization

* Reduced intermediate garbage in the process of
  generating HTTP requests and parsing HTTP responses

-------------------

HttpClient 3.x features that have NOT yet been ported
-------------------
* NTLM authentication scheme

* RFC2965 cookie policy (Cookie2)

* Support for multipart MIME coded entities

-------------------

Changelog
